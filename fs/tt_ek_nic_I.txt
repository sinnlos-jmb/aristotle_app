Book 1


Chapter1

{1094a} Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly every action and rational choice [Πᾶσα τέχνη καὶ πᾶσα μέθοδος, ὁμοίως δὲ πρᾶξίς τε καὶ προαίρεσις], is thought to aim at some good [ἀγαθοῦ τινὸς ἐφίεσθαι δοκεῖ]; and so the good has been aptly described as that at which everything aims [διὸ καλῶς_ἀπεφήναντο τἀγαθόν, οὗ πάντ᾽ ἐφίεται]. But it is clear that there is some difference between ends: some ends are activities, while others are products which are additional to the activities [διαφορὰ δέ τις φαίνεται τῶν τελῶν· τὰ μὲν γάρ εἰσιν ἐνέργειαι, τὰ δὲ παρ᾽ αὐτὰς {5} ἔργα τινά]. In cases where there are ends additional to the actions, the products are by their nature better than the activities [ὧν δ᾽ εἰσὶ τέλη τινὰ παρὰ τὰς πράξεις, ἐν τούτοις βελτίω πέφυκε τῶν ἐνεργειῶν τὰ ἔργα].

Since there are many actions, skills, and sciences, it happens that there are many ends as well [πολλῶν δὲ πράξεων οὐσῶν καὶ τεχνῶν καὶ ἐπιστημῶν πολλὰ γίνεται καὶ τὰ τέλη]: the end of medicine is health, that of shipbuilding, a ship, that of military science, victory, and that of domestic economy, wealth [ἰατρικῆς μὲν γὰρ ὑγίεια, ναυπηγικῆς δὲ πλοῖον, στρατηγικῆς δὲ νίκη, οἰκονομικῆς δὲ πλοῦτος]. But when any of these actions, skills, or sciences comes under some single faculty [ὅσαι {10} δ᾽ εἰσὶ τῶν τοιούτων ὑπὸ μίαν τινὰ δύναμιν, καθάπερ ὑπὸ τὴν ἱππικὴν χαλινοποιικὴ καὶ ὅσαι ἄλλαι τῶν ἱππικῶν ὀργάνων εἰσίν] --as bridlemaking and other sciences concerned with equine equipment come under the science of horsemanship, and horsemanship itself and every action in warfare come under military science, and others similarly come under others-- then in all these cases the end of the master science is more worthy of choice than the ends of the subordinate sciences [αὕτη δὲ καὶ πᾶσα πολεμικὴ πρᾶξις ὑπὸ τὴν στρατηγικήν, κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν δὴ τρόπον ἄλλαι ὑφ᾽ ἑτέρας: ἐν ἁπάσαις δὲ τὰ τῶν ἀρχιτεκτονικῶν τέλη πάντων {15} ἐστὶν αἱρετώτερα τῶν ὑπ᾽ αὐτά], since these latter ends are pursued also for the sake of the former [τούτων γὰρ χάριν κἀκεῖνα διώκεται]. And it makes no difference whether the ends of the actions are the activities themselves, or something else additional to them, as in the sciences just mentioned [διαφέρει δ᾽ οὐδὲν τὰς ἐνεργείας αὐτὰς εἶναι τὰ τέλη τῶν πράξεων ἢ παρὰ ταύτας ἄλλο τι, καθάπερ ἐπὶ τῶν λεχθεισῶν ἐπιστημῶν].

Chapter 2 


So if what is done has some end that we want for its own sake, and everything else we want is for the sake of this end; and if we do not choose everything for the sake of something else [Εἰ δή τι τέλος ἐστὶ τῶν πρακτῶν ὃ δι᾽ αὑτὸ βουλόμεθα, τἆλλα δὲ διὰ τοῦτο, καὶ μὴ {20} πάντα δι᾽ ἕτερον αἱρούμεθα] (because this would lead to an infinite progression, making our desire fruitless and vain [πρόεισι γὰρ οὕτω γ᾽ εἰς ἄπειρον, ὥστ᾽ εἶναι κενὴν καὶ ματαίαν τὴν ὄρεξιν]), then clearly this will be the good, indeed the chief good [δῆλον ὡς τοῦτ᾽ ἂν εἴη τἀγαθὸν καὶ τὸ ἄριστον]. Surely, then, knowledge of the good must be very important for our lives? And if, like archers, we have a target, are we not more likely to hit the right mark? [ἆρ᾽ οὖν καὶ πρὸς τὸν βίον ἡ γνῶσις αὐτοῦ μεγάλην ἔχει ῥοπήν, καὶ καθάπερ τοξόται σκοπὸν ἔχοντες μᾶλλον ἂν τυγχάνοιμεν τοῦ δέοντος] If so, we must try at least roughly to comprehend what it is and which science or faculty is concerned with it [εἰ δ᾽ {25} οὕτω, πειρατέον τύπῳ γε περιλαβεῖν αὐτὸ τί ποτ᾽ ἐστὶ καὶ τίνος τῶν ἐπιστημῶν ἢ δυνάμεων].

Knowledge of the good would seem to be the concern of the most authoritative science, the highest master science [δόξειε δ᾽ ἂν τῆς κυριωτάτης καὶ μάλιστα ἀρχιτεκτονικῆς]. And this is obviously the science of politics [τοιαύτη δ᾽ ἡ πολιτικὴ φαίνεται], because it lays down which of the sciences there should be in cities, <1094b> and which each class of person should learn and up to what level [τίνας γὰρ εἶναι χρεὼν τῶν ἐπιστημῶν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι, 1094b καὶ ποίας ἑκάστους μανθάνειν καὶ μέχρι τίνος, αὕτη διατάσσει]. And we see that even the most honourable of faculties, such as military science, domestic economy, and rhetoric, come under it [ὁρῶμεν δὲ καὶ τὰς ἐντιμοτάτας τῶν δυνάμεων ὑπὸ ταύτην οὔσας, οἷον στρατηγικὴν οἰκονομικὴν ῥητορικήν]. Since political science employs the other sciences, and also lays down laws about what we should do and refrain from, its end will include the ends of the others, and will therefore be the human good [χρωμένης δὲ ταύτης ταῖς λοιπαῖς [πρακτικαῖς] τῶν ἐπιστημῶν, {5} ἔτι δὲ νομοθετούσης τί δεῖ πράττειν καὶ τίνων ἀπέχεσθαι, τὸ ταύτης τέλος περιέχοι ἂν τὰ τῶν ἄλλων, ὥστε τοῦτ᾽ ἂν εἴη τἀνθρώπινον ἀγαθόν]. For even if the good is the same for an individual as for a city, that of the city is obviously a greater and more complete thing to obtain and preserve [εἰ γὰρ καὶ ταὐτόν ἐστιν ἑνὶ καὶ πόλει, μεῖζόν γε καὶ τελειότερον τὸ τῆς πόλεως φαίνεται καὶ λαβεῖν καὶ σῴζειν]. For while the good of an individual is a desirable thing, what is good for a people or for cities is a nobler and more godlike thing [ἀγαπητὸν μὲν γὰρ καὶ ἑνὶ {10} μόνῳ, κάλλιον δὲ καὶ θειότερον ἔθνει καὶ πόλεσιν]. Our enquiry, then, is a kind of political science, since these are the ends it is aiming at [ἡ μὲν οὖν μέθοδος τούτων ἐφίεται, πολιτική τις οὖσα].

And it makes no difference whether the ends of the actions are the activities themselves, or something else additional to them, as in the sciences just mentioned [διαφέρει δ᾽ οὐδὲν τὰς ἐνεργείας αὐτὰς εἶναι τὰ τέλη τῶν πράξεων ἢ παρὰ ταύτας ἄλλο τι, καθάπερ ἐπὶ τῶν λεχθεισῶν ἐπιστημῶν].

Chapter 3


Our account will be adequate if its clarity is in line with the subject-matter [Λέγοιτο δ᾽ ἂν ἱκανῶς, εἰ κατὰ τὴν ὑποκειμένην ὕλην διασαφηθείη], because the same degree of precision is not to be sought in all discussions, any more than in works of craftsmanship [τὸ γὰρ ἀκριβὲς οὐχ ὁμοίως ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς λόγοις ἐπιζητητέον, ὥσπερ οὐδ᾽ ἐν τοῖς δημιουργουμένοις]. The spheres of what is noble and what is just, which political science examines, admit of a good deal of diversity and variation, so that they seem to exist only by convention and not by nature [τὰ δὲ καλὰ καὶ τὰ δίκαια, {15} περὶ ὧν ἡ πολιτικὴ σκοπεῖται, πολλὴν ἔχει διαφορὰν καὶ πλάνην, ὥστε δοκεῖν νόμῳ μόνον εἶναι, φύσει δὲ μή]. Goods vary in this way as well, since it happens that, for many, good things have harmful consequences: some people have been ruined by wealth, and others by courage [τοιαύτην δέ τινα πλάνην ἔχει καὶ τἀγαθὰ διὰ τὸ πολλοῖς συμβαίνειν βλάβας ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν· ἤδη γάρ τινες ἀπώλοντο διὰ πλοῦτον, ἕτεροι δὲ δι᾽ ἀνδρείαν]. So we should be content, since we are discussing things like these in such a way, to demonstrate the truth sketchily and in outline, and, because we are making generalizations on the basis of generalizations, to draw conclusions along the same lines [ἀγαπητὸν οὖν περὶ τοιούτων {20} καὶ ἐκ τοιούτων λέγοντας παχυλῶς καὶ τύπῳ τἀληθὲς ἐνδείκνυσθαι, καὶ περὶ τῶν ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολὺ καὶ ἐκ τοιούτων λέγοντας τοιαῦτα καὶ συμπεραίνεσθαι]. Indeed, the details of our claims, then, should be looked at in the same way [τὸν αὐτὸν δὴ τρόπον καὶ ἀποδέχεσθαι χρεὼν ἕκαστα τῶν λεγομένων], since it is a mark of an educated person to look in each area for only that degree of accuracy that the nature of the subject permits [πεπαιδευμένου γάρ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον τἀκριβὲς ἐπιζητεῖν καθ᾽ ἕκαστον {25} γένος, ἐφ᾽ ὅσον ἡ τοῦ πράγματος φύσις ἐπιδέχεται]. 	Accepting from a mathematician claims that are mere probabilities seems rather like demanding logical proofs from a rhetorician [παραπλήσιον γὰρ φαίνεται μαθηματικοῦ τε πιθανολογοῦντος ἀποδέχεσθαι καὶ ῥητορικὸν ἀποδείξεις ἀπαιτεῖν].

Each person judges well what he knows, and is a good judge of this [ Ἕκαστος δὲ κρίνει καλῶς ἃ γινώσκει, καὶ τούτων ἐστὶν ἀγαθὸς κριτής]. <1095a> So, in any subject, the person educated in it is a good judge of that subject, and the person educated in all subjects is a good judge without qualification [καθ᾽ ἕκαστον μὲν ἄρα ὁ πεπαιδευμένος, ἁπλῶς δ᾽ ὁ περὶ πᾶν πεπαιδευμένος]. This is why a young person is not fitted to hear lectures on political science [διὸ τῆς πολιτικῆς οὐκ ἔστιν οἰκεῖος ἀκροατὴς ὁ νέος], since our discussions begin from and concern the actions of life, and of these he has no experience [ἄπειρος γὰρ τῶν κατὰ τὸν βίον πράξεων, οἱ λόγοι δ᾽ ἐκ τούτων καὶ περὶ τούτων]. Again, because of his tendency to follow his feelings, his studies will be useless and to no purpose, since the end of the study is not knowledge but action [ἔτι δὲ τοῖς πάθεσιν ἀκολουθητικὸς ὢν {5} ματαίως (in vain) ἀκούσεται καὶ ἀνωφελῶς (unprofitably), ἐπειδὴ τὸ τέλος ἐστὶν οὐ γνῶσις ἀλλὰ πρᾶξις]. It makes no difference whether he is young in years or juvenile in character [διαφέρει δ᾽ οὐδὲν νέος (young) τὴν ἡλικίαν ἢ τὸ ἦθος (in character) νεαρός], since the deficiency is not related to age, but occurs because of his living and engaging in each of his pursuits according to his feelings [οὐ γὰρ παρὰ τὸν χρόνον ἡ ἔλλειψις, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ κατὰ πάθος ζῆν καὶ διώκειν (pursue, chase after) ἕκαστα]. For knowledge is a waste of time for people like this, just as it is for those without self-restraint [τοῖς γὰρ τοιούτοις ἀνόνητος ἡ γνῶσις γίνεται, καθάπερ τοῖς ἀκρατέσιν]. But knowledge of the matters that concern political science will prove very beneficial to those who follow reason both in shaping their desires and in acting [{10} τοῖς δὲ κατὰ λόγον τὰς ὀρέξεις ποιουμένοις καὶ πράττουσι πολυωφελὲς (very useful) ἂν εἴη τὸ περὶ τούτων εἰδέναι (about these things to know)].

Let these comments --about the student, how our statements are to be taken, and the task we have set ourselves-- serve as our preamble [Καὶ --περὶ μὲν ἀκροατοῦ (listener), καὶ πῶς ἀποδεκτέον, καὶ τί προτιθέμεθα-- πεφροιμιάσθω ταῦτα].

Chapter 4


Let us continue with the argument, and, since all knowledge and rational choice seek some good, let us say what we claim to be the aim of political science -- that is, of all the good things to be done, what is the highest [Λέγωμεν δ᾽ ἀναλαβόντες, ἐπειδὴ πᾶσα γνῶσις καὶ προαίρεσις {15} ἀγαθοῦ, τινὸς ὀρέγεται, τί ἐστὶν οὗ λέγομεν τὴν πολιτικὴν ἐφίεσθαι καὶ τί τὸ πάντων (of all) ἀκρότατον (the highest) τῶν πρακτῶν ἀγαθῶν (of the practical goods)]. Most people, I should think, agree about what it is called [ὀνόματι μὲν οὖν σχεδὸν ὑπὸ τῶν πλείστων ὁμολογεῖται (it's agreed)], since both the masses and sophisticated people call it happiness, understanding being happy as equivalent to living well and acting well [τὴν γὰρ εὐδαιμονίαν καὶ οἱ πολλοὶ καὶ οἱ χαρίεντες λέγουσιν, τὸ δ᾽ εὖ ζῆν καὶ τὸ εὖ πράττειν ταὐτὸν ὑπολαμβάνουσι {20} τῷ εὐδαιμονεῖν]. They disagree about substantive conceptions of happiness, the masses giving an account which differs from that of the philosophers [περὶ δὲ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας, τί ἐστιν, ἀμφισβητοῦσι (they dispute) καὶ οὐχ ὁμοίως (not similarly) οἱ πολλοὶ τοῖς σοφοῖς ἀποδιδόασιν]. For the masses think it is something straightforward and obvious, like pleasure, wealth, or honour, some thinking it to be one thing, others another [οἳ μὲν γὰρ τῶν ἐναργῶν (obvious) τι καὶ φανερῶν (manifest), οἷον ἡδονὴν ἢ πλοῦτον ἢ τιμήν, ἄλλοι δ᾽ ἄλλο]. Often the same person can give different accounts [πολλάκις (often) δὲ καὶ ὁ αὐτὸς ἕτερον]: when he is ill, it is health; when he is poor, it is wealth [νοσήσας μὲν γὰρ ὑγίειαν, πενόμενος δὲ {25} πλοῦτον]. And when people are aware of their ignorance, they marvel at those who say it is some grand thing quite beyond them [συνειδότες δ᾽ ἑαυτοῖς ἄγνοιαν τοὺς (those) μέγα τι καὶ ὑπὲρ αὐτοὺς λέγοντας θαυμάζουσιν]. Certain thinkers used to believe that beyond these many good things there is something else good in itself, which makes all these good things good [ἔνιοι (some) δ᾽ ᾤοντο παρὰ τὰ πολλὰ ταῦτα ἀγαθὰ ἄλλο τι καθ᾽ αὑτὸ εἶναι, ὃ καὶ τούτοις πᾶσιν αἴτιόν ἐστι τοῦ εἶναι ἀγαθά]. Examining all the views offered would presumably be rather a waste of time, and it is enough to look at the most prevalent ones or those that seem to have something to be said for them [ἁπάσας (all) μὲν οὖν ἐξετάζειν τὰς δόξας ματαιότερον (more futile) ἴσως ἐστίν, ἱκανὸν δὲ τὰς μάλιστα (the most) {30} ἐπιπολαζούσας ἢ δοκούσας ἔχειν τινὰ λόγον].

Let us not forget, however, that there is a difference between arguments from first principles and arguments to first principles [Μὴ λανθανέτω δ᾽ ἡμᾶς ὅτι διαφέρουσιν οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν λόγοι καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχάς]. For Plato rightly used to wonder about this,  <1095b> raising the question whether the way to go is from first principles or to first principles, as in the racecourse whether it is from the judges to the post or back again as well [εὖ γὰρ καὶ ὁ Πλάτων ἠπόρει τοῦτο καὶ ἐζήτει, πότερον ἀπὸ τῶν ἀρχῶν ἢ ἐπὶ τὰς ἀρχάς ἐστιν ἡ ὁδός, <1095b> ὥσπερ ἐν τῷ σταδίῳ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀθλοθετῶν ἐπὶ τὸ πέρας ἢ ἀνάπαλιν]. For while we should begin from things known, they are known in two senses: known by us, and known without qualification [ἀρκτέον μὲν γὰρ ἀπὸ τῶν γνωρίμων, ταῦτα δὲ διττῶς τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἡμῖν τὰ δ᾽ ἁπλῶς]. Presumably we have to begin from things known by us [ἴσως οὖν ἡμῖν γε ἀρκτέον ἀπὸ τῶν ἡμῖν γνωρίμων]. This is why anyone who is going to be a competent student in the spheres of what is noble and what is just --in a word, politics-- must be brought up well in his habits [διὸ δεῖ (therefore it's necessary) τοῖς ἔθεσιν (habits) ἦχθαι καλῶς τὸν {5} περὶ καλῶν καὶ δικαίων καὶ ὅλως τῶν πολιτικῶν ἀκουσόμενον ἱκανῶς (adequately)]. For the first principle is the belief that something is the case, and if this is sufficiently clear, he will not need the reason why as well [ἀρχὴ γὰρ τὸ ὅτι, καὶ εἰ τοῦτο φαίνοιτο ἀρκούντως, οὐδὲν προσδεήσει (no need) τοῦ διότι (of the why)]. Such a person is in possession of the first principles, or could easily grasp them [ὁ δὲ τοιοῦτος ἔχει ἢ λάβοι ἂν ἀρχὰς ῥᾳδίως]. Anyone with neither of these possibilities open to him should listen to Hesiod (Works and Days, 293, 295-7) [ᾧ δὲ μηδέτερον ὑπάρχει τούτων, ἀκουσάτω τῶν Ἡσιόδου· {10}]:
This person who understands everything for himself is the best of all [οὗτος μὲν πανάριστος ὃς αὐτὸς πάντα νοήσῃ], 
And noble is that one who heeds good advice [ἐσθλὸς δ᾽ αὖ κἀκεῖνος ὃς εὖ εἰπόντι πίθηται].
But he who neither understands it for himself nor takes to heart [ὃς δέ κε μήτ᾽ αὐτὸς νοέῃ μήτ᾽ ἄλλου ἀκούων]
What he hears from another is a worthless man [ἐν θυμῷ (heart, spirit) βάλληται, ὃ δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἀχρήιος ἀνήρ (man)].

Chapter 5


But let us begin from where we digressed [Ἡμεῖς δὲ λέγωμεν ὅθεν παρεξέβημεν]. For people seem, not unreasonably, to base their conception of the good --happiness, that is-- on their own lives. The masses, the coarsest people, see it as pleasure, and so they like the life of enjoyment [τὸ γὰρ ἀγαθὸν {15} καὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν οὐκ ἀλόγως ἐοίκασιν ἐκ τῶν βίων ὑπολαμβάνειν οἱ μὲν πολλοὶ καὶ φορτικώτατοι τὴν ἡδονήν· διὸ καὶ τὸν βίον ἀγαπῶσι τὸν ἀπολαυστικόν]. There are three especially prominent types of life: that just mentioned, the life of politics, and thirdly the life of contemplation [τρεῖς γάρ εἰσι μάλιστα οἱ προύχοντες, ὅ τε νῦν εἰρημένος καὶ ὁ πολιτικὸς καὶ τρίτος ὁ θεωρητικός]. The masses appear quite slavish by rationally choosing a life fit only for cattle; but they are worthy of consideration because many of those in power feel the same as Sardanapallus [οἱ μὲν οὖν πολλοὶ παντελῶς {20} ἀνδραποδώδεις φαίνονται βοσκημάτων βίον προαιρούμενοι, τυγχάνουσι δὲ λόγου διὰ τὸ πολλοὺς τῶν ἐν ταῖς ἐξουσίαις ὁμοιοπαθεῖν Σαρδαναπάλλῳ].2

Sophisticated people, men of action, see happiness as honour, since honour is pretty much the end of the political life [οἱ δὲ χαρίεντες καὶ πρακτικοὶ τιμήν· τοῦ γὰρ πολιτικοῦ βίου σχεδὸν (pretty much/ nearly) τοῦτο τέλος ({is} the end)]. Honour, however, seems too shallow to be an object of our inquiry, since honour appears to depend more on those who honour than on the person honoured, whereas we surmise the good to be something of one's own that cannot easily be taken away [φαίνεται δ᾽ ἐπιπολαιότερον (superficial) εἶναι τοῦ ζητουμένου· δοκεῖ γὰρ ἐν {25} τοῖς τιμῶσι μᾶλλον εἶναι ἢ ἐν τῷ τιμωμένῳ, τἀγαθὸν δὲ οἰκεῖόν τι (one's own) καὶ δυσαφαίρετον (hard to remove) εἶναι μαντευόμεθα (we surmise)]. Again, they seem to pursue honour in order to convince themselves of their goodness [ἔτι δ᾽ ἐοίκασι τὴν τιμὴν διώκειν ἵνα πιστεύσωσιν ἑαυτοὺς ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι]; at least, they seek to be honoured by people with practical wisdom, among those who are familiar with them, and for their virtue [ζητοῦσι γοῦν ὑπὸ τῶν φρονίμων τιμᾶσθαι, καὶ παρ᾽ οἷς γινώσκονται, καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἀρετῇ]. So it is clear that, to these people at least, virtue is superior [δῆλον οὖν ὅτι κατά γε {30} τούτους ἡ ἀρετὴ κρείττων].

One might, perhaps, suppose virtue rather than honour to be the end of the political life [τάχα δὲ καὶ μᾶλλον (rather) ἄν τις τέλος τοῦ πολιτικοῦ βίου ταύτην (this, ie, arete) ὑπολάβοι (suppose)]. But even virtue seems, in itself, to be lacking something, since apparently one can possess virtue even when one is asleep, or inactive throughout one's life, and also when one is suffering terribly or experiencing the greatest misfortunes [φαίνεται δὲ ἀτελεστέρα καὶ αὕτη· δοκεῖ γὰρ ἐνδέχεσθαι (to be possible) καὶ καθεύδειν (sleep) ἔχοντα τὴν ἀρετὴν ἢ (or) ἀπρακτεῖν (to be inactive) διὰ βίου, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις κακοπαθεῖν (to suffer misfortune) καὶ ἀτυχεῖν (to be unlucky) τὰ μέγιστα]; <1096a> and no one would call a person living this kind of life happy, unless he were closely defending a thesis [1096a τὸν δ᾽ οὕτω ζῶντα οὐδεὶς ἂν εὐδαιμονίσειεν, εἰ μὴ θέσιν διαφυλάττων]. But enough of this, because these issues have been sufficiently dealt with in our everyday discussions [καὶ περὶ μὲν τούτων ἅλις· ἱκανῶς γὰρ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐγκυκλίοις [popular writings] εἴρηται περὶ αὐτῶν].

The third kind of life is that of contemplation, which we shall examine in what follows [τρίτος δ᾽ ἐστὶν ὁ θεωρητικός, ὑπὲρ οὗ {5} τὴν ἐπίσκεψιν ἐν τοῖς ἑπομένοις ποιησόμεθα].

The life of making money is a life people are, as it were, forced into, and wealth is clearly not the good we are seeking, since it is merely useful, for getting something else [Ὁ δὲ χρηματιστὴς βίαιός τις ἐστίν, καὶ ὁ πλοῦτος δῆλον ὅτι οὐ τὸ ζητούμενον ἀγαθόν· χρήσιμον γὰρ καὶ ἄλλου χάριν]. One would be better off seeing as ends the things mentioned before, because they are valued for themselves [διὸ μᾶλλον τὰ πρότερον λεχθέντα τέλη τις ἂν ὑπολάβοι· δι᾽ αὑτὰ γὰρ ἀγαπᾶται]. But they do not appear to be ends either, and many arguments have been offered against them [φαίνεται δ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ἐκεῖνα· καίτοι πολλοὶ λόγοι {10} πρὸς αὐτὰ καταβέβληνται]. So let us put them to one side [ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἀφείσθω].





..
Chapter 6 


It would perhaps be quite a good idea to examine the notion of the universal and go through any problems there are in the way it is employed, despite the fact that such an inquiry turns out to be difficult going because those who introduced the Forms are friends [Τὸ δὲ καθόλου βέλτιον ἴσως ἐπισκέψασθαι καὶ διαπορῆσαι πῶς λέγεται, καίπερ προσάντους τῆς τοιαύτης ζητήσεως γινομένης διὰ τὸ φίλους ἄνδρας εἰσαγαγεῖν τὰ εἴδη]. It will presumably be thought better, indeed one's duty, to do away with even what is close to one's heart in order to preserve the truth, especially when one is a philosopher [δόξειε δ᾽ ἂν ἴσως βέλτιον εἶναι καὶ δεῖν ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ γε τῆς {15} ἀληθείας καὶ τὰ οἰκεῖα ἀναιρεῖν, ἄλλως τε καὶ φιλοσόφους ὄντας]. For one might love both, but it is nevertheless a sacred duty to prefer the truth to one's friends [ἀμφοῖν γὰρ ὄντοιν φίλοιν ὅσιον προτιμᾶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν].

Those who introduced this idea did not set up Forms for series in which they spoke of priority and posteriority, and this is why they did not postulate a Form of numbers [Οἱ δὴ κομίσαντες τὴν δόξαν ταύτην οὐκ ἐποίουν ἰδέας ἐν οἷς τὸ πρότερον καὶ ὕστερον ἔλεγον, διόπερ οὐδὲ τῶν ἀριθμῶν ἰδέαν κατεσκεύαζον]. But the good is spoken of in the categories of substance, of quality and of relation; and that which exists in itself, namely, substance, is naturally prior to what is relative (since this seems like an offshoot and attribute of what is). So there could not be some common Form over and above these goods [τὸ δ᾽ ἀγαθὸν λέγεται καὶ ἐν {20} τῷ τί ἐστι καὶ ἐν τῷ ποιῷ καὶ ἐν τῷ πρός τι, τὸ δὲ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ καὶ ἡ οὐσία πρότερον τῇ φύσει τοῦ πρός τι (παραφυάδι γὰρ τοῦτ᾽ ἔοικε καὶ συμβεβηκότι τοῦ ὄντος)· ὥστ᾽ οὐκ ἂν εἴη κοινή τις ἐπὶ τούτοις ἰδέα]. 

Again, good is spoken of in as many senses as is being: it is used in the category of substance, as for instance God and intellect, in that of quality (the virtues), in that of quantity (the right amount), in that of relation (the useful), in that of time (the right moment), and in that of place (the right locality), and so on [ἔτι δ᾽ ἐπεὶ τἀγαθὸν ἰσαχῶς λέγεται τῷ ὄντι (καὶ γὰρ ἐν τῷ τί λέγεται, οἷον ὁ θεὸς καὶ {25} ὁ νοῦς, καὶ ἐν τῷ ποιῷ αἱ ἀρεταί, καὶ ἐν τῷ ποσῷ τὸ μέτριον, καὶ ἐν τῷ πρός τι τὸ χρήσιμον, καὶ ἐν χρόνῳ καιρός, καὶ ἐν τόπῳ δίαιτα καὶ ἕτερα τοιαῦτα)]. So it is clear that there could not be one common universal, because it would be spoken of not in all the categories, but in only one [δῆλον ὡς οὐκ ἂν εἴη κοινόν τι καθόλου καὶ ἕν· οὐ γὰρ ἂν ἐλέγετ᾽ ἐν πάσαις ταῖς κατηγορίαις, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν μιᾷ μόνῃ].

Again, since there is a single science for the things answering to each individual Form, there should have been some single science for all the goods [ἔτι δ᾽ ἐπεὶ τῶν {30} κατὰ μίαν ἰδέαν μία καὶ ἐπιστήμη, καὶ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἁπάντων ἦν ἂν μία τις ἐπιστήμη]. But as it happens there are many sciences, even of the things in one category. For example, the right moment: in war, it is military science, in illness, medicine; or the right amount (τοῦ μετρίου): in diet, it is medicine, in exercise, gymnastics [νῦν δ᾽ εἰσὶ πολλαὶ καὶ τῶν ὑπὸ μίαν κατηγορίαν, οἷον καιροῦ, ἐν πολέμῳ μὲν γὰρ στρατηγικὴ ἐν νόσῳ δ᾽ ἰατρική, καὶ τοῦ μετρίου ἐν τροφῇ μὲν ἰατρικὴ ἐν πόνοις δὲ γυμναστική].

One might also be puzzled about what on earth they mean by speaking of a 'thing-in-itself', <1096b> since the definition of humanity is one and the same in humanity-in-itself and human being [ἀπορήσειε (might wonder) δ᾽ ἄν τις τί [35] ποτε καὶ βούλονται (they mean) λέγειν αὐτοέκαστον, εἴπερ ἔν τε αὐτοανθρώπῳ <1096b> καὶ ἐν ἀνθρώπῳ εἷς καὶ ὁ αὐτὸς λόγος ἐστὶν ὁ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου]. Inasmuch as they are human, they will not differ. And if this is so, the same will be true of good [ᾗ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος, οὐδὲν διοίσουσιν· εἰ δ᾽ οὕτως, οὐδ᾽ ᾗ ἀγαθόν].

Nor will a thing be any the more good by being eternal, since a long-lasting white thing is no whiter than a short-lived one [ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ τῷ ἀίδιον εἶναι μᾶλλον ἀγαθὸν ἔσται, εἴπερ μηδὲ λευκότερον τὸ πολυχρόνιον τοῦ {5} ἐφημέρου].

The Pythagoreans4 seem to give a more plausible account of the good, when they place the one in their column of goods; and Speusippus5 seems to have followed them in this. But let this be the topic of another discussion [πιθανώτερον δ᾽ ἐοίκασιν οἱ Πυθαγόρειοι λέγειν περὶ αὐτοῦ, τιθέντες ἐν τῇ τῶν ἀγαθῶν συστοιχίᾳ τὸ ἕν· οἷς δὴ καὶ Σπεύσιππος ἐπακολουθῆσαι δοκεῖ].

An objection to what we have said might be that they did not speak about every good, and that things which are pursued and valued for their own sake are called good by reference to a single Form, while those that tend to be instrumental to these things or in some way to preserve them or prevent their contraries are called good for the sake of these -- in a different way, in other words [τοῖς δὲ λεχθεῖσιν ἀμφισβήτησίς τις ὑποφαίνεται διὰ τὸ μὴ περὶ παντὸς ἀγαθοῦ τοὺς λόγους {10} εἰρῆσθαι, λέγεσθαι δὲ καθ᾽ ἓν εἶδος τὰ καθ᾽ αὑτὰ διωκόμενα καὶ ἀγαπώμενα, τὰ δὲ ποιητικὰ τούτων ἢ φυλακτικά πως ἢ τῶν ἐναντίων κωλυτικὰ διὰ ταῦτα λέγεσθαι καὶ τρόπον ἄλλον]. Clearly, then, things should be called good in two senses: things good in themselves, and things good for the sake of things good in themselves [δῆλον οὖν ὅτι διττῶς λέγοιτ᾽ ἂν τἀγαθά, καὶ τὰ μὲν καθ᾽ αὑτά, θάτερα δὲ διὰ ταῦτα]. So let us distinguish things good in themselves from those that are means to them and see whether the former are called good with reference to a single Form [χωρίσαντες {15} οὖν ἀπὸ τῶν ὠφελίμων τὰ καθ᾽ αὑτὰ σκεψώμεθα εἰ λέγεται κατὰ μίαν ἰδέαν]. What sort of things should one put in the class of things good in themselves? Those that are sought even on their own, such as understanding (φρονεῖν), sight, certain types of pleasure, and honours? For even if we do seek these for the sake of something else, one would nevertheless put them in the class of things good in themselves [καθ᾽ αὑτὰ δὲ ποῖα θείη τις ἄν; ἢ ὅσα καὶ μονούμενα διώκεται, οἷον τὸ φρονεῖν καὶ ὁρᾶν καὶ ἡδοναί τινες καὶ τιμαί; ταῦτα γὰρ εἰ καὶ δι᾽ ἄλλο τι διώκομεν, ὅμως τῶν καθ᾽ αὑτὰ ἀγαθῶν θείη τις ἄν]. Perhaps nothing but the Form? Then the Form would be useless [ἢ οὐδ᾽ {20} ἄλλο οὐδὲν πλὴν τῆς ἰδέας; ὥστε μάταιον (useless) ἔσται τὸ εἶδος]. But if those other things are in the class of things good in themselves, the same definition of the good will have to be exemplified in all of them, as is that of whiteness in snow and white lead [εἰ δὲ καὶ ταῦτ᾽ ἐστὶ τῶν καθ᾽ αὑτά, τὸν τἀγαθοῦ λόγον ἐν ἅπασιν αὐτοῖς τὸν αὐτὸν ἐμφαίνεσθαι δεήσει, καθάπερ ἐν χιόνι καὶ ψιμυθίῳ τὸν τῆς λευκότητος]. But the defrecnitions of honour, practical wisdom and pleasure are distinct, and differ with respect to their being good [τιμῆς δὲ καὶ φρονήσεως καὶ ἡδονῆς ἕτεροι καὶ διαφέροντες οἱ λόγοι ταύτῃ {25} ᾗ ἀγαθά]. There is therefore no common good answering to a single Form [οὐκ ἔστιν ἄρα τὸ ἀγαθὸν κοινόν τι κατὰ μίαν ἰδέαν].

But how, then, are things called good? For they do not seem like items that have the same name by chance [Ἀλλὰ πῶς δὴ λέγεται; οὐ γὰρ ἔοικε τοῖς γε ἀπὸ τύχης ὁμωνύμοις]. Is it through their all deriving from one good, or their all contributing to one good, or is it rather by analogy? [ἀλλ᾽ ἆρά γε τῷ ἀφ᾽ ἑνὸς εἶναι ἢ πρὸς ἓν ἅπαντα συντελεῖν, ἢ μᾶλλον κατ᾽ ἀναλογίαν] For as sight is good in the body, so intellect is in the soul, and so on in other cases [ὡς γὰρ ἐν σώματι ὄψις, ἐν ψυχῇ νοῦς, καὶ ἄλλο δὴ ἐν ἄλλῳ]. But perhaps we should put these questions aside for the time being, since seeking precision in these matters would be more appropriate to another area of philosophy [{30} ἀλλ᾽ ἴσως ταῦτα μὲν ἀφετέον τὸ νῦν· ἐξακριβοῦν γὰρ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ἄλλης ἂν εἴη φιλοσοφίας οἰκειότερον].

But the same is true of the Form. For even if there is some one good predicated across categories, or a good that is separate, itself in itself, clearly it could not be an object of action nor something attainable by a human being, which is the sort of thing we are looking for [ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ περὶ τῆς ἰδέας· εἰ γὰρ καὶ ἔστιν ἕν τι τὸ κοινῇ κατηγορούμενον ἀγαθὸν ἢ χωριστὸν αὐτό τι καθ᾽ αὑτό, δῆλον ὡς οὐκ ἂν εἴη πρακτὸν οὐδὲ κτητὸν ἀνθρώπῳ· νῦν δὲ τοιοῦτόν τι {35} ζητεῖται].

Perhaps someone might think that it would be better to understand it with an eye to those goods <1097a> that are attainable and objects of action [τάχα δέ τῳ δόξειεν ἂν βέλτιον εἶναι γνωρίζειν αὐτὸ <1097a> πρὸς τὰ κτητὰ καὶ πρακτὰ τῶν ἀγαθῶν]. For with this as a sort of paradigm we shall know better the goods that are goods for us, and if we know them, we shall attain them [οἷον γὰρ παράδειγμα τοῦτ᾽ ἔχοντες μᾶλλον εἰσόμεθα καὶ τὰ ἡμῖν ἀγαθά, κἂν εἰδῶμεν, ἐπιτευξόμεθα αὐτῶν]. This argument has some plausibility, but seems to be inconsistent with the sciences: they all aim at some good and seek to remedy any lack of the good, but they leave to one side understanding the universal good [πιθανότητα μὲν οὖν τινα ἔχει ὁ λόγος, ἔοικε δὲ ταῖς ἐπιστήμαις διαφωνεῖν· {5} πᾶσαι γὰρ ἀγαθοῦ τινὸς ἐφιέμεναι καὶ τὸ ἐνδεὲς ἐπιζητοῦσαι παραλείπουσι τὴν γνῶσιν αὐτοῦ]. And if there were such an important aid available, it is surely not reasonable to think that all practitioners of skills (τεχνίτας) would be ignorant of it and fail even to look for it [καίτοι βοήθημα τηλικοῦτον τοὺς τεχνίτας ἅπαντας ἀγνοεῖν καὶ μηδ᾽ ἐπιζητεῖν οὐκ εὔλογον].

There is also a difficulty in seeing how a weaver or carpenter (τέκτων) will be helped in practising his skill by knowing this good-in-itself, or how someone who has contemplated the Form itself will be a better doctor or general [ἄπορον δὲ καὶ τί ὠφεληθήσεται (will be benefited) ὑφάντης ἢ τέκτων πρὸς τὴν αὑτοῦ τέχνην εἰδὼς (knowing) τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἀγαθόν, {10} ἢ πῶς ἰατρικώτερος ἢ στρατηγικώτερος ἔσται ὁ τὴν ἰδέαν αὐτὴν τεθεαμένος]. For apparently it is not just health that the doctor attends to, but human health, or perhaps rather the health of a particular person, given that he treats each person individually [φαίνεται μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲ τὴν ὑγίειαν οὕτως ἐπισκοπεῖν ὁ ἰατρός, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἀνθρώπου, μᾶλλον δ᾽ ἴσως τὴν τοῦδε· καθ᾽ ἕκαστον γὰρ ἰατρεύει].

That is enough on these issues [καὶ περὶ μὲν τούτων ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον εἰρήσθω].

Chapter 7

{15} But let us return again to the good we are looking for, to see what it might be [πάλιν δ᾽ ἐπανέλθωμεν ἐπὶ τὸ ζητούμενον ἀγαθόν, τί ποτ᾽ ἂν εἴη], since it appears to vary between different actions and skills: it is one thing in medicine, another in military science, and so on in all other cases [φαίνεται μὲν γὰρ ἄλλο ἐν ἄλλῃ (in another) πράξει καὶ τέχνῃ: ἄλλο γὰρ ἐν ἰατρικῇ καὶ στρατηγικῇ καὶ ταῖς λοιπαῖς ὁμοίως]. What then is the good in each case? Surely it is that for the sake of which other things are done? In medicine it is health, in military science, victory, in housebuilding, a house, and in other cases something else [τί οὖν ἑκάστης τἀγαθόν; ἢ οὗ χάριν τὰ λοιπὰ πράττεται; τοῦτο δ᾽ ἐν ἰατρικῇ μὲν ὑγίεια, ἐν στρατηγικῇ {20} δὲ νίκη, ἐν οἰκοδομικῇ δ᾽ οἰκία, ἐν ἄλλῳ δ᾽ ἄλλο]; in every action and rational choice the end is the good, since it is for the sake of the end that everyone does everything else [ἐν ἁπάσῃ δὲ πράξει καὶ προαιρέσει τὸ τέλος: τούτου γὰρ ἕνεκα (for the sake of this_τούτου) τὰ λοιπὰ πράττουσι πάντες (everyone)]. So if everything that is done has some end, this will be the good among things done, and if there are several ends, these will be the goods [ὥστ᾽ εἴ τι τῶν πρακτῶν ἁπάντων ἐστὶ τέλος, τοῦτ᾽ ἂν εἴη τὸ πρακτὸν ἀγαθόν, εἰ (if) δὲ πλείω, ταῦτα].

Our argument (λόγος), then, has arrived (ἀφῖκται) at the same point by a different route, but we should try to make it still clearer [μεταβαίνων δὴ ὁ λόγος εἰς ταὐτὸν ἀφῖκται: τοῦτο {25} δ᾽ ἔτι μᾶλλον διασαφῆσαι πειρατέον]. Since there appear to be several ends, and some of these, such as wealth, flutes, and implements (ὄργανα) generally, we choose (αἱρούμεθα) as means to other ends, it is clear that not all ends are complete [ἐπεὶ δὲ πλείω φαίνεται τὰ τέλη, τούτων δ᾽ αἱρούμεθά τινα δι᾽ ἕτερον, οἷον πλοῦτον αὐλοὺς καὶ ὅλως τὰ ὄργανα, δῆλον ὡς οὐκ ἔστι πάντα τέλεια]. But the chief good manifestly is something complete [τὸ δ᾽ ἄριστον τέλειόν τι φαίνεται]. So if there is only one end that is complete (τέλειον), this will be what we are looking for, and if there are several of them, the most complete [ὥστ᾽ εἰ μέν ἐστιν ἕν τι μόνον τέλειον, τοῦτ᾽ ἂν εἴη τὸ ζητούμενον,{30} εἰ δὲ πλείω, τὸ τελειότατον τούτων (of these)]. We speak of that which is worth pursuing for its own sake (τὸ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ διωκτὸν) as more complete than that which is worth pursuing only for the sake of something else, and that which is never worth choosing for the sake of something else as more complete than things that are worth choosing both in themselves and for the sake of this end [τελειότερον δὲ λέγομεν τὸ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ διωκτὸν τοῦ δι᾽ ἕτερον καὶ τὸ μηδέποτε (never) δι᾽ ἄλλο αἱρετὸν (chosen) τῶν καὶ (both) καθ᾽ αὑτὰ καὶ δι᾽ αὐτὸ αἱρετῶν]. And so that which is always worth choosing in itself and never for the sake of something else we call complete without qualification [καὶ ἁπλῶς δὴ τέλειον τὸ καθ᾽ αὑτὸ αἱρετὸν ἀεὶ καὶ μηδέποτε δι᾽ ἄλλο].

Happiness in particular is believed to be complete without qualification, since we always choose it for itself and never for the sake of {1097b} anything else. Honour, pleasure, intellect (νοῦν), and every virtue we do indeed choose for themselves (since we would choose each of them even if they had no good effects) [τοιοῦτον δ᾽ ἡ εὐδαιμονία μάλιστ᾽ εἶναι δοκεῖ: {1097b} ταύτην γὰρ αἱρούμεθα ἀεὶ δι᾽ αὐτὴν καὶ οὐδέποτε δι᾽ ἄλλο (never for another), τιμὴν δὲ καὶ ἡδονὴν καὶ νοῦν καὶ πᾶσαν ἀρετὴν αἱρούμεθα μὲν καὶ δι᾽ αὐτά （μηθενὸς γὰρ ἀποβαίνοντος (resulting) ἑλοίμεθ᾽ (we would choose) ἂν ἕκαστον αὐτῶν]. But we choose them also for the sake of happiness, on the assumption that through them we shall live a life of happiness (εὐδαιμονήσειν) [αἱρούμεθα δὲ καὶ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας χάριν, {5} διὰ τούτων ὑπολαμβάνοντες εὐδαιμονήσειν: future active infinitive of the verb εὐδαιμονέω]; whereas happiness no one chooses for the sake of any of these nor indeed for the sake of anything else [τὴν δ᾽ εὐδαιμονίαν οὐδεὶς αἱρεῖται τούτων χάριν, οὐδ᾽ ὅλως (generally) δι᾽ ἄλλο].

The same conclusion seems to follow from considering self-sufficiency (αὐταρκείας), since the complete good is thought to be self-sufficient [φαίνεται δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῆς αὐταρκείας τὸ αὐτὸ συμβαίνειν: τὸ γὰρ τέλειον ἀγαθὸν αὔταρκες εἶναι δοκεῖ (it seems)]. We are applying the term 'self-sufficient' not to a person on his own, living a solitary life, but to a person living alongside his parents, children, wife, and friends and fellow-citizens generally, since a human being is by nature a social being [τὸ δ᾽ αὔταρκες λέγομεν οὐκ αὐτῷ μόνῳ, τῷ ζῶντι βίον μονώτην, ἀλλὰ καὶ γονεῦσι (parents) {10} καὶ τέκνοις καὶ γυναικὶ καὶ ὅλως (in general) τοῖς φίλοις καὶ πολίταις, ἐπειδὴ (since) φύσει πολιτικὸν ὁ ἄνθρωπος]. We must, however, set some limit (ὅρος) on these, since if we stretch things so far as to include ancestors and descendants and friends of friends we shall end up with an infinite series [τούτων δὲ ληπτέος ὅρος τις: ἐπεκτείνοντι γὰρ ἐπὶ τοὺς γονεῖς καὶ τοὺς ἀπογόνους (descendants) καὶ τῶν φίλων τοὺς φίλους εἰς (into) ἄπειρον πρόεισιν (go forward)]. But we must think about this later [ἀλλὰ τοῦτο μὲν εἰσαῦθις ἐπισκεπτέον]. For now, we take what is self-sufficient to be that which on its own (μονούμενον) makes life worthy of choice and lacking in nothing [τὸ δ᾽ αὔταρκες τίθεμεν ὃ μονούμενον {15} αἱρετὸν ποιεῖ τὸν βίον καὶ μηδενὸς ἐνδεᾶ (in nothing lacking)]. We think happiness to be such, and indeed the thing most of all worth choosing, not counted as just one thing among others [τοιοῦτον δὲ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν οἰόμεθα (we think) εἶναι: ἔτι δὲ πάντων αἱρετωτάτην μὴ συναριθμουμένην]. Counted as just one thing among others it would clearly be more worthy of choice with even the least good added to it [συναριθμουμένην δὲ δῆλον (it's clear) ὡς αἱρετωτέραν μετὰ τοῦ ἐλαχίστου τῶν ἀγαθῶν]. For the good added would cause an increase in goodness, and the greater good is always more worthy of choice [ὑπεροχὴ γὰρ ἀγαθῶν γίνεται τὸ προστιθέμενον, ἀγαθῶν δὲ τὸ μεῖζον αἱρετώτερον ἀεί (always)]. Happiness, then, is obviously something complete and self- sufficient, in that it is the end of what is done [{20} τέλειον δή τι φαίνεται καὶ αὔταρκες ἡ εὐδαιμονία, τῶν πρακτῶν οὖσα (being) τέλος].

.
But perhaps saying that happiness is the chief good sounds rather platitudinous, and one might want its nature (τί ἐστιν) to be specified still more clearly [ἀλλ᾽ ἴσως τὴν μὲν εὐδαιμονίαν τὸ ἄριστον λέγειν ὁμολογούμενόν τι φαίνεται, ποθεῖται (it's desired) δ᾽ ἐναργέστερον (more clearly) τί ἐστιν ἔτι (still) λεχθῆναι (to be said)]. It is possible that we might achieve that if we grasp the characteristic activity (ἔργον) of a human being [τάχα δὴ γένοιτ᾽ ἂν τοῦτ᾽, εἰ ληφθείη (if it might be grasped) τὸ ἔργον {25} τοῦ ἀνθρώπου]. For just as the good --the doing well (τὸ εὖ)-- of a flute-player, a sculptor or any practitioner of a skill, or generally whatever has some characteristic activity or action, is thought to lie in its characteristic activity, so the same would seem to be true of a human being, if indeed he has a characteristic activity [ὥσπερ γὰρ αὐλητῇ (flautista) καὶ ἀγαλματοποιῷ (escultor) καὶ παντὶ τεχνίτῃ, καὶ ὅλως ὧν (of whom) ἔστιν ἔργον τι καὶ πρᾶξις, ἐν τῷ ἔργῳ (in the function) δοκεῖ τἀγαθὸν εἶναι καὶ τὸ εὖ, οὕτω δόξειεν ἂν καὶ ἀνθρώπῳ, εἴπερ ἔστι τι ἔργον αὐτοῦ].

Well, do the carpenter and the tanner have characteristic activities and actions, and a human being none? [πότερον οὖν τέκτονος μὲν καὶ σκυτέως ἔστιν ἔργα τινὰ καὶ πράξεις, ἀνθρώπου δ᾽ {30} οὐδέν ἐστιν] Has nature left him without a characteristic activity to perform? [ἀλλ᾽ ἀργὸν πέφυκεν (without function it has naturally come to be)]. Or, as there seem to be characteristic activities of the eye, the hand, the foot, and generally of each part of the body, should one assume that a human being has some characteristic activity over and above all these? [ἢ καθάπερ ὀφθαλμοῦ καὶ χειρὸς καὶ ποδὸς καὶ ὅλως ἑκάστου τῶν μορίων φαίνεταί τι ἔργον, οὕτω καὶ ἀνθρώπου παρὰ πάντα ταῦτα θείη τις ἂν ἔργον τι]. What sort of thing might it be, then? For living (ζῆν) is obviously shared even by plants, while what we are looking for is something special to a human being [τί οὖν δὴ τοῦτ᾽ ἂν εἴη ποτέ; τὸ μὲν γὰρ ζῆν κοινὸν εἶναι φαίνεται καὶ τοῖς φυτοῖς, ζητεῖται δὲ τὸ ἴδιον]. We should therefore rule out the life of nourishment and growth [{1098} ἀφοριστέον ἄρα (therefore) τήν τε θρεπτικὴν καὶ τὴν αὐξητικὴν ζωήν]. Next would be some sort of sentient life, but this again is clearly shared by the horse, the ox, indeed by every animal [ἑπομένη δὲ αἰσθητική τις ἂν εἴη, φαίνεται δὲ καὶ αὐτὴ κοινὴ καὶ ἵππῳ καὶ βοῒ καὶ παντὶ ζῴῳ]. What remains is a life, concerned in some way with action, of the element that possesses reason [λείπεται δὴ πρακτική τις τοῦ λόγον ἔχοντος]. (Of this element, one part has reason in being obedient to reason, the other in possessing it and engaging in thought (διανοούμενον) [τούτου δὲ τὸ μὲν ὡς ἐπιπειθὲς λόγῳ, τὸ δ᾽ ὡς {5} ἔχον καὶ διανοούμενον]). As this kind of life can be spoken of in two ways, let us assume that we are talking about the life concerned with action in the sense of activity (κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν), because this seems to be the more proper use of the phrase [διττῶς δὲ καὶ ταύτης λεγομένης τὴν κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν θετέον: κυριώτερον γὰρ αὕτη δοκεῖ λέγεσθαι].

--review--
If the characteristic activity of a human being is an activity of the soul in accordance with reason or at least not entirely lacking it [εἰ δ᾽ ἐστὶν ἔργον ἀνθρώπου ψυχῆς ἐνέργεια κατὰ λόγον ἢ μὴ ἄνευ λόγου]; and if we say that the characteristic activity of anything is the same in kind as that of a good thing of the same type, as in the case of a lyre-player and a good lyre-player [τὸ δ᾽ αὐτό φαμεν ἔργον εἶναι τῷ γένει τοῦδε καὶ τοῦδε σπουδαίου, ὥσπερ (just as) κιθαριστοῦ καὶ σπουδαίου {10} κιθαριστοῦ], and so on, without qualification, in the same way in every case, the superiority of the good one in virtue being an addition to the characteristic activity (for the characteristic activity of the lyre-player is to play the lyre, that of the good lyre-player to play it well) [καὶ ἁπλῶς δὴ τοῦτ᾽ ἐπὶ πάντων, προστιθεμένης τῆς κατὰ τὴν ἀρετὴν ὑπεροχῆς πρὸς τὸ ἔργον: κιθαριστοῦ μὲν γὰρ κιθαρίζειν, σπουδαίου δὲ τὸ εὖ]; then if this is so, and we take the characteristic activity of a human being to be a certain kind of life; and if we take this kind of life to be activity of the soul and actions in accordance with reason [εἰ δ᾽ οὕτως, ἀνθρώπου δὲ τίθεμεν ἔργον ζωήν τινα, ταύτην δὲ ψυχῆς ἐνέργειαν καὶ πράξεις μετὰ λόγου], and the characteristic activity of the good person to be to carry this out well and nobly, and a characteristic activity to be accomplished well when it is accomplished in accordance with the appropriate virtue [σπουδαίου δ᾽ ἀνδρὸς εὖ ταῦτα καὶ {15} καλῶς, ἕκαστον δ᾽ εὖ κατὰ τὴν οἰκείαν ἀρετὴν ἀποτελεῖται]; then if this is so, the human good turns out to be activity of the soul in accordance with virtue, and if there are several virtues, in accordance with the best and most complete [εἰ δ᾽ οὕτω, τὸ ἀνθρώπινον ἀγαθὸν ψυχῆς ἐνέργεια γίνεται (comes to be) κατ᾽ ἀρετήν, εἰ δὲ πλείους αἱ ἀρεταί, κατὰ τὴν ἀρίστην καὶ τελειοτάτην]. Again, this must be over a complete life [Ἔτι δ᾽ ἐν βίῳ τελείῳ]. For one swallow does not make a summer, nor one day. Neither does one day or a short time make someone blessed and happy [μία γὰρ χελιδὼν (golondrina) ἔαρ οὐ ποιεῖ, οὐδὲ μία ἡμέρα· οὕτω δὲ οὐδὲ μακάριον καὶ εὐδαίμονα {20} μία ἡμέρα (one day) οὐδ᾽ ὀλίγος χρόνος (short time)].

.
So let this serve as an outline of the good, since perhaps we have first to make a rough sketch, and then fill it in later [περιγεγράφθω μὲν οὖν τἀγαθὸν ταύτῃ (in this way): δεῖ γὰρ ἴσως ὑποτυπῶσαι πρῶτον (to sketch it in outline first), εἶθ᾽ ὕστερον ἀναγράψαι (to delineate it fully)]. One would think that anyone with a good outline (περιγραφῇ) can carry on and complete the details, and that in this task time will bring much to light or else offer useful assistance [δόξειε δ᾽ ἂν παντὸς εἶναι προαγαγεῖν καὶ διαρθρῶσαι τὰ καλῶς ἔχοντα τῇ περιγραφῇ, καὶ ὁ χρόνος τῶν τοιούτων εὑρετὴς ἢ συνεργὸς ἀγαθὸς εἶναι]. This is how skills have come to advance, because anyone can fill in the gaps [ὅθεν καὶ τῶν τεχνῶν {25} γεγόνασιν αἱ ἐπιδόσεις (advancements): παντὸς γὰρ προσθεῖναι τὸ ἐλλεῖπον (add what is lacking)]. But we must bear in mind what we said above, and not look for the same precision in everything, but in each case whatever is in line with the subject-matter, and the degree appropriate to the inquiry [μεμνῆσθαι δὲ καὶ τῶν προειρημένων (lo dicho) χρή, καὶ τὴν ἀκρίβειαν (precisión) μὴ ὁμοίως ἐν ἅπασιν ἐπιζητεῖν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν ἑκάστοις (each) κατὰ τὴν ὑποκειμένην ὕλην (subject matter) καὶ ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον ἐφ᾽ ὅσον οἰκεῖον τῇ μεθόδῳ (as is proper to the method)]. A carpenter and a geometrician approach the right-angle in different ways: the carpenter in so far as it is useful for his work, while the geometrician seeks to know what it is, or what sort of thing it is, in that he aims to contemplate the truth (θεατὴς τἀληθοῦς) [καὶ γὰρ τέκτων καὶ γεωμέτρης διαφερόντως {30} ἐπιζητοῦσι τὴν ὀρθήν: ὃ μὲν γὰρ ἐφ᾽ ὅσον χρησίμη πρὸς τὸ ἔργον, ὃ δὲ τί ἐστιν ἢ ποῖόν τι (what sort): θεατὴς γὰρ τἀληθοῦς]. We should therefore do the same in every other case, so that side-issues do not dominate the tasks in hand [τὸν αὐτὸν δὴ τρόπον (way) καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ποιητέον (must be done), ὅπως μὴ τὰ πάρεργα (by-products) τῶν ἔργων πλείω γίνηται]. Nor should we demand an explanation (αἰτίαν) in the same way in all cases. A sound proof that something is the case will suffice in some instances, as with first principles, where the fact itself is a starting-point, that is, a first principle [{1028b} οὐκ ἀπαιτητέον (must be demanded) δ᾽ οὐδὲ τὴν αἰτίαν ἐν ἅπασιν ὁμοίως, ἀλλ᾽ ἱκανὸν (sufficient) ἔν τισι τὸ ὅτι δειχθῆναι καλῶς, οἷον (for example) καὶ περὶ τὰς ἀρχάς: τὸ δ᾽ ὅτι πρῶτον καὶ ἀρχή]. Some first principles we see (θεωροῦνται) by induction, some by perception, some by a kind of habituation, and others in other ways [τῶν ἀρχῶν δ᾽ αἳ (some) μὲν ἐπαγωγῇ θεωροῦνται, αἳ δ᾽ αἰσθήσει, αἳ δ᾽ ἐθισμῷ τινί, καὶ ἄλλαι δ᾽ ἄλλως]. We must try to investigate each type in the way appropriate to its nature, and take pains to define each of them well, because they are very important in what follows [μετιέναι {5} δὲ πειρατέον ἑκάστας ᾗ πεφύκασιν, καὶ σπουδαστέον [one must strive] ὅπως διορισθῶσι καλῶς: μεγάλην γὰρ ἔχουσι ῥοπὴν (they have a great influence on) πρὸς τὰ ἑπόμενα]. The first principle seems to be more than half the whole thing, and to clarify many of the issues we are inquiring into [δοκεῖ γὰρ πλεῖον ἢ ἥμισυ (half) τοῦ παντὸς εἶναι ἡ ἀρχή, καὶ πολλὰ συμφανῆ γίνεσθαι (clear to become) δι᾽ αὐτῆς τῶν ζητουμένων (of the things being sought)].





..
Chapter 8

But we must consider the first principle in the light not only of our conclusion and premises (λόγος), but of the things that people say about it. For all the data (πάντα ὑπάρχοντα) harmonize (συνᾴδει) with the truth, but soon clash with falsity [σκεπτέον δὲ περὶ αὐτῆς οὐ μόνον ἐκ τοῦ συμπεράσματος (conclusion) {10} καὶ ἐξ ὧν ὁ λόγος, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐκ τῶν λεγομένων περὶ αὐτῆς: τῷ μὲν γὰρ ἀληθεῖ πάντα συνᾴδει τὰ ὑπάρχοντα, τῷ δὲ ψευδεῖ ταχὺ διαφωνεῖ τἀληθές].

Goods have been classifed into three groups: those called external goods, goods of the soul, and goods of the body. Goods of the soul are the ones we call most strictly and most especially good, and the actions and activities of the soul we may attribute to the soul [νενεμημένων δὴ τῶν ἀγαθῶν τριχῇ, καὶ τῶν μὲν ἐκτὸς λεγομένων τῶν δὲ περὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα, τὰ περὶ ψυχὴν κυριώτατα λέγομεν καὶ {15} μάλιστα ἀγαθά, τὰς δὲ πράξεις καὶ τὰς ἐνεργείας τὰς ψυχικὰς περὶ ψυχὴν τίθεμεν]. Our conception of happiness, then, is plausible in so far as it is accords with this view, a venerable one that has been accepted by philosophers [ὥστε καλῶς ἂν λέγοιτο κατά γε ταύτην τὴν δόξαν παλαιὰν οὖσαν καὶ ὁμολογουμένην ὑπὸ τῶν φιλοσοφούντων].

Our account is right also in that we are claiming that the end consists in certain actions and activities. For the end thus turns out to be a good of the soul and not an external good [ὀρθῶς δὲ καὶ ὅτι πράξεις τινὲς λέγονται καὶ ἐνέργειαι τὸ τέλος: οὕτω (thus) γὰρ τῶν περὶ ψυχὴν ἀγαθῶν {20} γίνεται καὶ οὐ τῶν ἐκτός].

Another belief that harmonizes with our account is that the happy person lives well and acts well, for we have claimed that happiness is pretty much a kind of living well and acting well [συνᾴδει δὲ τῷ λόγῳ καὶ τὸ εὖ ζῆν καὶ τὸ εὖ πράττειν τὸν εὐδαίμονα: σχεδὸν γὰρ εὐζωία τις εἴρηται καὶ εὐπραξία].

Again, all the things that people look for in happiness appear to have been included in our account [φαίνεται δὲ καὶ τὰ ἐπιζητούμενα τὰ περὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ἅπανθ᾽ ὑπάρχειν (belong) τῷ λεχθέντι]. Some think that happiness is virtue, some practical wisdom, others a kind of wisdom; while others think it is a combination of these or one of these along with more or less pleasure. Yet others include external prosperity as well [τοῖς μὲν γὰρ ἀρετὴ τοῖς δὲ φρόνησις ἄλλοις δὲ σοφία τις εἶναι δοκεῖ, {25} τοῖς δὲ ταῦτα ἢ τούτων τι μεθ᾽ ἡδονῆς ἢ οὐκ ἄνευ ἡδονῆς: ἕτεροι δὲ καὶ τὴν ἐκτὸς εὐετηρίαν συμπαραλαμβάνουσιν]. Some of these views are popular and of long standing, while others are those of a few distinguished men. It is not likely that either group is utterly mistaken, but rather that at least one component of their view is on the right track, perhaps even most of them [τούτων δὲ τὰ μὲν πολλοὶ καὶ παλαιοὶ (ancient) λέγουσιν, τὰ δὲ ὀλίγοι καὶ ἔνδοξοι ἄνδρες: οὐδετέρους δὲ τούτων εὔλογον διαμαρτάνειν τοῖς ὅλοις, ἀλλ᾽ ἕν γέ τι ἢ καὶ τὰ πλεῖστα κατορθοῦν (to hit the mark)].

Our account of happiness is in harmony with those who say that happiness is virtue or some particular virtue, since activity in accordance with virtue is characteristic of virtue [{30} τοῖς μὲν οὖν λέγουσι τὴν ἀρετὴν ἢ ἀρετήν τινα συνῳδός (harmony) ἐστιν ὁ λόγος: ταύτης γάρ ἐστιν ἡ κατ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐνέργεια (for to virtue belongs virtuous activity)]. Presumably, though, it makes a great difference whether we conceive of the chief good as consisting in possession or in use, that is to say, in a state or in an activity [διαφέρει δὲ ἴσως οὐ μικρὸν ἐν κτήσει ἢ χρήσει (possession or use) τὸ ἄριστον ὑπολαμβάνειν (to consider), καὶ ἐν ἕξει ἢ ἐνεργείᾳ]. For while a state can exist without producing any good consequences, as it does in the case of a person sleeping or lying idle for some other reason, this is impossible for an activity: it will necessarily engage in action, and do so well [τὴν μὲν γὰρ ἕξιν (disposition) ἐνδέχεται (it's possible) μηδὲν ἀγαθὸν ἀποτελεῖν (to produce) ὑπάρχουσαν (being present), {1099a} οἷον τῷ καθεύδοντι (eg sleeping) ἢ καὶ ἄλλως πως ἐξηργηκότι, τὴν δ᾽ ἐνέργειαν οὐχ οἷόν τε: πράξει γὰρ ἐξ ἀνάγκης (from necessity), καὶ εὖ πράξει]. As in the Olympic Games it is not the most attractive and the strongest who are crowned, but those who compete (since it is from this group that winners come), so in life it is those who act rightly who will attain what is noble and good [ὥσπερ δ᾽ Ὀλυμπίασιν οὐχ οἱ κάλλιστοι καὶ ἰσχυρότατοι στεφανοῦνται ἀλλ᾽ {5} οἱ ἀγωνιζόμενοι (but those competing) （τούτων γάρ τινες νικῶσιν）, οὕτω καὶ τῶν ἐν τῷ βίῳ καλῶν κἀγαθῶν οἱ πράττοντες ὀρθῶς (thos doing rightly) ἐπήβολοι γίνονται (felicidad=>actuar)].

It is also the case that the life of these people is pleasurable in itself [ἔστι δὲ καὶ ὁ βίος αὐτῶν καθ᾽ αὑτὸν ἡδύς]. For experiencing pleasure is an aspect of the soul, and each person finds pleasure in that of which he is said to be fond, as a horse-lover finds it in a horse, and someone who likes wonderful sights finds it in a wonderful sight. In the same way, a lover of justice finds it in the sphere of justice and in general a person with virtue finds pleasure in what accords with virtue [τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἥδεσθαι τῶν ψυχικῶν, ἑκάστῳ δ᾽ ἐστὶν ἡδὺ πρὸς ὃ λέγεται φιλοτοιοῦτος, οἷον ἵππος μὲν τῷ φιλίππῳ, θέαμα {10} δὲ τῷ φιλοθεώρῳ: τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ τρόπον καὶ τὰ δίκαια τῷ φιλοδικαίῳ καὶ ὅλως τὰ κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν τῷ φιλαρέτῳ]. The pleasures of the masses, because they are not pleasant by nature, conflict with one another, but the pleasures of those who are fond of noble things are pleasant by nature. Actions in accordance with virtue are like this, so that they are pleasant to these people as well as in themselves [τοῖς μὲν οὖν πολλοῖς τὰ ἡδέα μάχεται (conflict) διὰ τὸ μὴ φύσει τοιαῦτ᾽ εἶναι, τοῖς δὲ φιλοκάλοις ἐστὶν ἡδέα τὰ φύσει ἡδέα: τοιαῦται δ᾽ αἱ κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν πράξεις, ὥστε καὶ τούτοις εἰσὶν ἡδεῖαι καὶ {15} καθ᾽ αὑτάς]. Their life therefore has no need of pleasure as some kind of lucky ornament, but contains its pleasure in itself [οὐδὲν δὴ προσδεῖται τῆς ἡδονῆς ὁ βίος αὐτῶν ὥσπερ περιάπτου τινός, ἀλλ᾽ ἔχει τὴν ἡδονὴν ἐν ἑαυτῷ]. Because, in addition to what we have already said, the person who does not enjoy noble actions is not good. For no one would call a person just if he did not enjoy acting justly, or generous if he did not enjoy generous actions; and the same goes for the other virtues [πρὸς τοῖς εἰρημένοις γὰρ οὐδ᾽ ἐστὶν ἀγαθὸς ὁ μὴ χαίρων (rejoicing) ταῖς καλαῖς πράξεσιν: οὔτε γὰρ δίκαιον οὐθεὶς ἂν εἴποι (would say) τὸν μὴ χαίροντα τῷ δικαιοπραγεῖν, οὔτ᾽ ἐλευθέριον (generous) τὸν μὴ χαίροντα {20} ταῖς ἐλευθερίοις πράξεσιν: ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων]. If this is so, it follows that actions in accordance with virtue are pleasant in themselves [εἰ δ᾽ οὕτω, καθ᾽ αὑτὰς ἂν εἶεν (they would be) αἱ (the) κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν πράξεις ἡδεῖαι]. But they are also good and noble as well as pleasant; indeed, since the good person is a good judge of goodness and nobility, actions in accordance with virtue have them to a degree greater than anything else; and here he judges in accordance with our views [ἀλλὰ μὴν καὶ ἀγαθαί γε καὶ καλαί, καὶ μάλιστα τούτων ἕκαστον, εἴπερ καλῶς κρίνει περὶ αὐτῶν ὁ σπουδαῖος (excellent person): κρίνει δ᾽ ὡς εἴπομεν (as we said)].

Happiness, then, is the best, the noblest and the pleasantest thing, and these qualities are not separate as in the inscription at Delos [ἄριστον ἄρα καὶ κάλλιστον καὶ ἥδιστον ἡ {25} εὐδαιμονία, καὶ οὐ διώρισται ταῦτα κατὰ τὸ Δηλιακὸν ἐπίγραμμα]:
Noblest is that which is the most just, and best is being healthy. 
But most pleasant is obtaining what one longs for. 
“κάλλιστον τὸ δικαιότατον, λῷστον δ᾽ ὑγιαίνειν:
ἥδιστον δὲ πέφυχ᾽ οὗ τις ἐρᾷ (loves) τὸ τυχεῖν (to attain).


This is because the best activities have all of these qualities. And we say that happiness consists in them, or one of them -- the best [ἅπαντα γὰρ ὑπάρχει ταῦτα ταῖς ἀρίσταις ἐνεργείαις: ταύτας {30} δέ, ἢ μίαν τούτων τὴν ἀρίστην, φαμὲν εἶναι (we say to be) τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν]. Nevertheless, as we suggested, happiness obviously needs the presence of external goods as well, since it is impossible, or at least no easy matter, to perform noble actions without resources [φαίνεται δ᾽ ὅμως καὶ τῶν ἐκτὸς ἀγαθῶν προσδεομένη, καθάπερ εἴπομεν: ἀδύνατον γὰρ ἢ οὐ ῥᾴδιον τὰ καλὰ πράττειν ἀχορήγητον ὄντα]. For in many actions, we employ, as if they were instruments at our disposal, friends, wealth, and political power [πολλὰ μὲν γὰρ πράττεται, {1099b} καθάπερ δι᾽ ὀργάνων, διὰ φίλων καὶ πλούτου καὶ πολιτικῆς δυνάμεως]. Again, being deprived of some things --such as high birth, noble children, beauty-- spoils our blessedness (μακάριον) [ἐνίων δὲ τητώμενοι ῥυπαίνουσι τὸ μακάριον (sullies blessedness), οἷον εὐγενείας εὐτεκνίας κάλλους]. For the person who is terribly ugly, of low birth, or solitary and childless is not really the sort to be happy, still less perhaps if he has children or friends who are thoroughly bad, or good but dead [οὐ πάνυ γὰρ εὐδαιμονικὸς ὁ τὴν ἰδέαν παναίσχης ἢ δυσγενὴς ἢ μονώτης καὶ ἄτεκνος, {5} ἔτι δ᾽ ἴσως ἧττον, εἴ τῳ πάγκακοι παῖδες εἶεν ἢ φίλοι, ἢ ἀγαθοὶ ὄντες τεθνᾶσιν]. As we have said, then, there seems to be an additional need for some sort of prosperity like this. For this reason, some identify happiness with good fortune, while others identify it with virtue [καθάπερ οὖν εἴπομεν, ἔοικε προσδεῖσθαι καὶ τῆς τοιαύτης εὐημερίας: ὅθεν εἰς ταὐτὸ τάττουσιν ἔνιοι τὴν εὐτυχίαν τῇ εὐδαιμονίᾳ, ἕτεροι δὲ τὴν ἀρετήν].

Chapter 9

Hence the problem also arises of whether happiness is to be acquired by learning, habituation, or some other training, or whether it comes by virtue of some divine dispensation (θείαν μοῖραν) or even by chance [ὅθεν καὶ ἀπορεῖται πότερόν (it's questioned whether) ἐστι μαθητὸν ἢ ἐθιστὸν ἢ καὶ {10} ἄλλως πως ἀσκητόν (acquired by practice), ἢ κατά τινα θείαν μοῖραν ἢ καὶ διὰ τύχην παραγίνεται (it comes to be present)]. If there is anything that the gods give to men, it is reasonable that happiness should be god-given, especially since it is so much the best thing in the human world [εἰ μὲν οὖν καὶ ἄλλο τί ἐστι θεῶν δώρημα (gift of the gods) ἀνθρώποις, εὔλογον καὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν θεόσδοτον εἶναι (be god-given), καὶ μάλιστα τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων ὅσῳ βέλτιστον]. But this question would perhaps be more suited to another inquiry. Even if it is not sent by the gods, however, but arises through virtue and some sort of learning or training, it is evidently one of the most divine things. For that which is the prize (ἆθλον) and end of virtue is clearly the chief good (ἄριστον), something both divine and blessed [ἀλλὰ τοῦτο μὲν ἴσως (perhaps) ἄλλης ἂν εἴη σκέψεως (inquiry) οἰκειότερον, φαίνεται δὲ κἂν εἰ {15} μὴ θεόπεμπτός (not god-sent) ἐστιν ἀλλὰ δι᾽ ἀρετὴν καί τινα μάθησιν ἢ ἄσκησιν παραγίνεται (it comes to be present), τῶν θειοτάτων εἶναι: τὸ γὰρ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἆθλον καὶ τέλος ἄριστον εἶναι φαίνεται καὶ θεῖόν τι καὶ μακάριον].

It would also be something widely shared, since everyone who was not incapacitated with regard to virtue could attain it through some kind of learning and personal effort [εἴη δ᾽ ἂν καὶ πολύκοινον (very common): δυνατὸν γὰρ ὑπάρξαι πᾶσι τοῖς μὴ πεπηρωμένοις (not incapacitated) πρὸς ἀρετὴν διά τινος μαθήσεως {20} καὶ ἐπιμελείας (care)]. And if it is better to be happy (εὐδαιμονεῖν) in this way than by chance, it is reasonable that happiness should be attained like this. For what is in accordance with nature is by nature as noble as it can be, and so is what is in accordance with skill and every other cause, especially that in accordance with the best cause [εἰ δ᾽ ἐστὶν οὕτω βέλτιον ἢ τὸ διὰ τύχην εὐδαιμονεῖν, εὔλογον ἔχειν οὕτως, εἴπερ τὰ κατὰ φύσιν, ὡς οἷόν τε κάλλιστα ἔχειν, οὕτω πέφυκεν (everything that depends on the action of nature is by nature as good as it can be), ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὰ κατὰ τέχνην καὶ πᾶσαν αἰτίαν, καὶ μάλιστα τὰ κατὰ τὴν ἀρίστην]. To entrust what is greatest and most noble to chance would be quite inappropriate [τὸ δὲ μέγιστον καὶ κάλλιστον ἐπιτρέψαι (to entrust) τύχῃ λίαν πλημμελὲς (excessively faulty) {25} ἂν εἴη].

The answer to our question is also manifest from our account of happiness, since we said that it was a certain kind of activity of the soul in accordance with virtue [συμφανὲς δ᾽ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ λόγου τὸ ζητούμενον (definition of happiness:things-being-sought): εἴρηται γὰρ ψυχῆς ἐνέργεια κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν ποιά τις]. And of the other goods, some are necessary conditions of happiness, and others are naturally helpful and serve as useful means to it [τῶν δὲ λοιπῶν (remaining) ἀγαθῶν τὰ μὲν ὑπάρχειν ἀναγκαῖον (necessary), τὰ δὲ συνεργὰ (cooperative) καὶ χρήσιμα (useful) πέφυκεν ὀργανικῶς].

And this agrees with what we said at the beginning. We took the end of political science to be the chief good, and political science is concerned most of all with producing citizens of a certain kind, namely, those who are both good and the sort to perform noble actions [ὁμολογούμενα δὲ ταῦτ᾽ ἂν εἴη καὶ τοῖς ἐν ἀρχῇ: τὸ γὰρ τῆς πολιτικῆς {30} τέλος ἄριστον ἐτίθεμεν (we posited), αὕτη δὲ πλείστην ἐπιμέλειαν ποιεῖται τοῦ ποιούς (of a certain quality) τινας καὶ ἀγαθοὺς τοὺς πολίτας ποιῆσαι καὶ πρακτικοὺς τῶν καλῶν].

It is with good reason, then, that we do not call an ox, a horse or any other animal happy, because none of them can share in such activity [εἰκότως (reasonably) οὖν οὔτε (neither) βοῦν οὔτε ἵππον οὔτε ἄλλο τῶν ζῴων οὐδὲν εὔδαιμον λέγομεν: {1100a} οὐδὲν γὰρ αὐτῶν οἷόν (none of them possible) τε κοινωνῆσαι τοιαύτης ἐνεργείας]. And for this same reason, a child is not happy either, since his age makes him incapable of doing such actions. If he is called blessed, he is being described as such on account of the potential he has [διὰ ταύτην δὲ τὴν αἰτίαν οὐδὲ παῖς εὐδαίμων ἐστίν: οὔπω (not yet) γὰρ πρακτικὸς τῶν τοιούτων διὰ τὴν ἡλικίαν (age): οἱ δὲ λεγόμενοι διὰ τὴν ἐλπίδα μακαρίζονται (boys who are called blessed are being congratulated by reason of the hopes we have for them)]. Since, as we have said, happiness requires complete virtue and a complete life [δεῖ γάρ, ὥσπερ εἴπομεν, καὶ ἀρετῆς τελείας {5} καὶ βίου τελείου]. For there are many vicissitudes in life, all sorts of chance things happen, and even the most successful can meet with great misfortunes in old age, as the story goes of Priam in Trojan times. No one calls someone happy who meets with misfortunes like these and comes to a wretched end [πολλαὶ γὰρ μεταβολαὶ γίνονται καὶ παντοῖαι τύχαι κατὰ (during) τὸν βίον, καὶ ἐνδέχεται τὸν μάλιστ᾽ εὐθηνοῦντα μεγάλαις συμφοραῖς (the most prosperous) περιπεσεῖν ἐπὶ γήρως (old age), καθάπερ (just as) ἐν τοῖς Τρωικοῖς περὶ Πριάμου μυθεύεται (is told): τὸν δὲ τοιαύταις χρησάμενον τύχαις (such fortunes having experienced) καὶ τελευτήσαντα ἀθλίως (miserably) οὐδεὶς εὐδαιμονίζει]. 






..
Chapter 10

Should we then call no one happy while they are alive, but rather, as Solon advises, wait to see the end? Even if we must assume this to be right, is it really the case that he is happy when he is dead? Or is this not quite ridiculous, especially for us, claiming as we do that happiness is some kind of activity? [{10} πότερον οὖν οὐδ᾽ ἄλλον οὐδένα ἀνθρώπων εὐδαιμονιστέον ἕως ἂν ζῇ (as long as he lives), κατὰ Σόλωνα δὲ χρεὼν τέλος ὁρᾶν (it's necessary to look at the end); εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ θετέον οὕτως (thus), ἆρά γε καὶ ἔστιν εὐδαίμων τότε ἐπειδὰν (when) ἀποθάνῃ; ἢ τοῦτό γε παντελῶς ἄτοπον (completely absurd), ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῖς λέγουσιν ἡμῖν (to us , especially for us who say that) ἐνέργειάν τινα τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν].
 
But if it is not that we call the dead person happy, and Solon meant not this, but that we can at that stage safely call a person blessed in so far as he is now beyond the reach of evils and misfortunes, even this claim is open to dispute [εἰ δὲ μὴ λέγομεν {15} τὸν τεθνεῶτα εὐδαίμονα, μηδὲ Σόλων τοῦτο βούλεται (intends), ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι τηνικαῦτα (at that time) ἄν τις ἀσφαλῶς (safely) μακαρίσειεν ἄνθρωπον ὡς ἐκτὸς (outside) ἤδη τῶν κακῶν ὄντα καὶ τῶν δυστυχημάτων (misfortunes), ἔχει μὲν καὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἀμφισβήτησίν (a dispute) τινα]. For both good and evil are thought to happen to a dead person, since they can happen to a person who is alive but not aware of them. Take, for example, honours and dishonours, and the good and bad fortunes of his children or his descendants generally [δοκεῖ γὰρ εἶναί τι τῷ τεθνεῶτι (to the dead) καὶ κακὸν καὶ ἀγαθόν, εἴπερ (if indeed) καὶ τῷ ζῶντι μὴ {20} αἰσθανομένῳ δέ, οἷον τιμαὶ (honours) καὶ ἀτιμίαι καὶ τέκνων καὶ ὅλως ἀπογόνων εὐπραξίαι (good fortunes) τε καὶ δυστυχίαι]. But this view also gives rise to a problem. Though a person may have lived a blessed life (μακαρίως βεβιωκότι) into his old age and died accordingly (κατὰ λόγον), many reverses may happen in connection with his descendants. Some of them may be good and meet with the life they deserve, others the contrary; and clearly the relation to their ancestors can vary to any degree [ἀπορίαν δὲ καὶ ταῦτα παρέχει: τῷ γὰρ μακαρίως βεβιωκότι μέχρι γήρως (old age) καὶ τελευτήσαντι κατὰ λόγον ἐνδέχεται (it's possible) πολλὰς μεταβολὰς συμβαίνειν (to happen) περὶ τοὺς ἐκγόνους, καὶ τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν {25} ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι καὶ τυχεῖν (to attain) βίου τοῦ κατ᾽ ἀξίαν, τοὺς δ᾽ ἐξ ἐναντίας (the opposite): δῆλον δ᾽ ὅτι καὶ τοῖς ἀποστήμασι πρὸς τοὺς γονεῖς παντοδαπῶς ἔχειν αὐτοὺς ἐνδέχεται (it's possible)]. It would indeed be odd if the dead person also were to share in these vicissitudes, and be sometimes happy, sometimes wretched. But it would also be odd if the fortunes of descendants had no effect on their ancestors for any time at all [ἄτοπον δὴ γίνοιτ᾽ ἄν, εἰ συμμεταβάλλοι καὶ ὁ τεθνεὼς (also the dead) καὶ γίνοιτο ὁτὲ μὲν εὐδαίμων πάλιν (again) δ᾽ ἄθλιος (miserable): ἄτοπον δὲ καὶ τὸ μηδὲν μηδ᾽ ἐπί {30} τινα χρόνον συνικνεῖσθαι τὰ τῶν ἐκγόνων τοῖς γονεῦσιν].
 
But we should return to the original question, since considering it (θεωρηθείη) might shed light on the one now under discussion [ἀλλ᾽ ἐπανιτέον (one must return) ἐπὶ τὸ πρότερον ἀπορηθέν: τάχα γὰρ ἂν θεωρηθείη (it might be observed) καὶ τὸ νῦν ἐπιζητούμενον ἐξ ἐκείνου]. If we must wait to see the end and only then call a person blessed, not as such but as having been so before, surely it is odd that --because we do not wish to call the living happy on account of possible changes in their fortunes, and because happiness is understood as something permanent (μόνιμόν) and not at all liable to change (εὐμετάβολον), while the living experience many turns of the wheel-- when he is happy, he will not be truly described as such? [εἰ δὴ τὸ τέλος ὁρᾶν δεῖ καὶ τότε μακαρίζειν ἕκαστον οὐχ ὡς ὄντα μακάριον ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι πρότερον ἦν, πῶς οὐκ ἄτοπον, εἰ ὅτ᾽ ἔστιν εὐδαίμων, {35} μὴ ἀληθεύσεται κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ τὸ ὑπάρχον {1100b} διὰ τὸ μὴ βούλεσθαι τοὺς ζῶντας (the living) εὐδαιμονίζειν διὰ τὰς μεταβολάς (because of the changes), καὶ διὰ τὸ μόνιμόν τι τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ὑπειληφέναι καὶ μηδαμῶς εὐμετάβολον, τὰς δὲ τύχας πολλάκις ἀνακυκλεῖσθαι περὶ τοὺς αὐτούς] For clearly, if we were to follow his fortunes, we should often call the same person happy and then wretched, representing the happy person as a kind of chameleon, or as having an unsound foundation [δῆλον γὰρ ὡς εἰ συνακολουθοίημεν {5} ταῖς τύχαις, τὸν αὐτὸν εὐδαίμονα καὶ πάλιν ἄθλιον ἐροῦμεν πολλάκις, χαμαιλέοντά τινα τὸν εὐδαίμονα ἀποφαίνοντες (showing) καὶ σαθρῶς ἱδρυμένον (weakly founded)]. Or is following a person's fortunes the wrong thing to do? For they are not what doing well or badly depend on, though, as we said, they are required as complementary to a fully human life. What really matter (κύριαι) for happiness are activities in accordance with virtue, and for the contrary of happiness the contrary kind of activities [ἢ τὸ μὲν ταῖς τύχαις ἐπακολουθεῖν οὐδαμῶς ὀρθόν (in no way correct?); οὐ (not) γὰρ ἐν ταύταις τὸ εὖ ἢ κακῶς, ἀλλὰ προσδεῖται τούτων ὁ ἀνθρώπινος βίος, καθάπερ εἴπομεν (just as we said), κύριαι {10} δ᾽ εἰσὶν αἱ (the) κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν ἐνέργειαι τῆς εὐδαιμονίας, αἱ δ᾽ ἐναντίαι (opposite ones) τοῦ ἐναντίου].
 
The question we have been discussing is further confirmation of our account [μαρτυρεῖ δὲ τῷ λόγῳ καὶ τὸ νῦν διαπορηθέν]; since nothing in the sphere of human achievement has more permanence than activities in accordance with virtue [περὶ οὐδὲν γὰρ οὕτως ὑπάρχει τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων ἔργων (no function of man) βεβαιότης (stability) ὡς περὶ τὰς ἐνεργείας τὰς κατ᾽ ἀρετήν]. They are thought to be more lasting even than the sciences, and the most honourable to be the more lasting, because the blessed spend their lives engaged, quite continually, in them above all (which seems to be why there is no forgetting in connection with these activities) [μονιμώτεραι γὰρ καὶ τῶν ἐπιστημῶν αὗται δοκοῦσιν εἶναι: {15} τούτων δ᾽ αὐτῶν αἱ τιμιώταται μονιμώτεραι διὰ τὸ μάλιστα καὶ συνεχέστατα (most continuously) καταζῆν ἐν αὐταῖς τοὺς μακαρίους: τοῦτο γὰρ ἔοικεν αἰτίῳ τοῦ μὴ γίνεσθαι περὶ αὐτὰς λήθην].

The quality in question, then, will belong to the happy person, and he will be happy throughout his life [ὑπάρξει δὴ τὸ ζητούμενον (thing being sought) τῷ εὐδαίμονι, καὶ ἔσται (he'll be) διὰ βίου τοιοῦτος (such a one)]. For he will spend all, or most, of his time engaged in action and contemplation in accordance with virtue. And he will bear changes in fortune in a particularly noble way and altogether gracefully (ἐμμελῶς), as one who is 'genuinely good' (ἀληθῶς ἀγαθὸς) and 'foursquare without a flaw' (cf. Simonides, greek poet) [ἀεὶ γὰρ ἢ μάλιστα πάντων πράξει καὶ θεωρήσει {20} τὰ κατ᾽ ἀρετήν, καὶ τὰς τύχας οἴσει (he'll bear) κάλλιστα καὶ πάντῃ πάντως ἐμμελῶς (in every way altogether harmoniously) ὅ γ᾽ ὡς ἀληθῶς ἀγαθὸς καὶ τετράγωνος ἄνευ ψόγου (blame)].

Many things, however, both large and small, happen by chance. Small pieces of good fortune or its contrary clearly do not affect the balance of life [πολλῶν δὲ γινομένων κατὰ τύχην καὶ διαφερόντων (differing) μεγέθει καὶ μικρότητι, τὰ μὲν μικρὰ τῶν εὐτυχημάτων, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀντικειμένων, δῆλον ὡς οὐ ποιεῖ {25} ῥοπὴν (a decisive change) τῆς ζωῆς]. But many great events, if they are good, will make a life more blessed, since they will themselves naturally embellish it, and the way a person deals with them can be noble and good (σπουδαία) [τὰ δὲ μεγάλα καὶ πολλὰ γινόμενα μὲν εὖ μακαριώτερον τὸν βίον ποιήσει (καὶ γὰρ αὐτὰ συνεπικοσμεῖν (to contribute to the beauty of) πέφυκεν, καὶ ἡ χρῆσις αὐτῶν καλὴ καὶ σπουδαία γίνεται)]. But if they turn out the other way, they will oppress and spoil what is blessed, since they bring distress with them and hinder many activities [ἀνάπαλιν (on the contrary) δὲ συμβαίνοντα (occurring) θλίβει καὶ λυμαίνεται (it crushes and mars) τὸ μακάριον: λύπας (sorrows) τε γὰρ ἐπιφέρει καὶ ἐμποδίζει πολλαῖς {30} ἐνεργείαις]. Nevertheless, even in their midst what is noble shines through, when a person calmly bears many great misfortunes, not through insensibility, but by being well bred and great-souled [ὅμως δὲ καὶ ἐν τούτοις διαλάμπει (shines through) τὸ καλόν, ἐπειδὰν φέρῃ (someone bears) τις εὐκόλως πολλὰς καὶ μεγάλας ἀτυχίας (many great misfortunes), μὴ δι᾽ ἀναλγησίαν, ἀλλὰ γεννάδας (noble) ὢν καὶ μεγαλόψυχος].
 
If activities are, as we have said, what really matter in life, no one blessed could become wretched, since he will never do hateful and petty a actions [εἰ δ᾽ εἰσὶν (are) αἱ ἐνέργειαι κύριαι τῆς ζωῆς, καθάπερ εἴπομεν (just as we said), οὐδεὶς ἂν γένοιτο τῶν μακαρίων ἄθλιος (miserable): οὐδέποτε {35} γὰρ πράξει τὰ μισητὰ (the hateful) καὶ τὰ φαῦλα]. For the truly good and wise (ἔμφρονα) person, we believe, bears all the fortunes of life with dignity and always does the noblest thing in the circumstances, as a good general does the most strategically appropriate thing with the army at his disposal, and a shoemaker makes the noblest shoe out of the leather he is given, and so on with other practitioners of skills [{1101a} τὸν γὰρ ὡς ἀληθῶς ἀγαθὸν καὶ ἔμφρονα πάσας οἰόμεθα (we believe) τὰς τύχας εὐσχημόνως (honorably) φέρειν καὶ ἐκ τῶν ὑπαρχόντων (existing circumstances) ἀεὶ (always) τὰ κάλλιστα πράττειν, καθάπερ (just as) καὶ στρατηγὸν ἀγαθὸν τῷ παρόντι στρατοπέδῳ (army) χρῆσθαι πολεμικώτατα καὶ σκυτοτόμον (zapatero) ἐκ τῶν δοθέντων {5} σκυτῶν (leathers) κάλλιστον ὑπόδημα (shoe) ποιεῖν: τὸν αὐτὸν δὲ τρόπον (the same way) καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους τεχνίτας ἅπαντας]. If this is so, the happy person could never become wretched, though he will not be blessed if he meets with luck like that of Priam [εἰ δ᾽ οὕτως, ἄθλιος μὲν οὐδέποτε γένοιτ᾽ ἂν ὁ εὐδαίμων, οὐ μὴν μακάριός γε, ἂν Πριαμικαῖς τύχαις περιπέσῃ (he should fall into)]. Nor indeed will he be unstable and changeable. He will not be shifted easily from happiness, and not by ordinary misfortunes, but by many grave ones. He would not recover from these to become happy again in a short space of time. If he does recover, it will be after a long and complete period of great and noble accomplishments [οὐδὲ δὴ ποικίλος γε καὶ εὐμετάβολος: οὔτε γὰρ ἐκ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας κινηθήσεται ῥᾳδίως, {10} οὐδ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν τυχόντων ἀτυχημάτων ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὸ μεγάλων καὶ πολλῶν, ἔκ τε τῶν τοιούτων οὐκ ἂν γένοιτο πάλιν εὐδαίμων ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ, ἀλλ᾽ εἴπερ, ἐν πολλῷ τινὶ καὶ τελείῳ, μεγάλων καὶ καλῶν ἐν αὐτῷ γενόμενος ἐπήβολος].

What is to prevent us, then, from concluding that the happy person is the one who, adequately furnished with external goods, engages in activities in accordance with complete virtue, not for just any period of time but over a complete life? [τί οὖν κωλύει λέγειν εὐδαίμονα τὸν κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν τελείαν {15} ἐνεργοῦντα καὶ τοῖς ἐκτὸς ἀγαθοῖς ἱκανῶς κεχορηγημένον μὴ τὸν τυχόντα χρόνον ἀλλὰ τέλειον βίον?] Or should we add that he will live like this in the future and die accordingly? The future is obscure to us, and we say that happiness is an end and altogether quite complete [ἢ προσθετέον καὶ βιωσόμενον (one who will have lived) οὕτω καὶ τελευτήσοντα (one who will have ended _his life_) κατὰ λόγον; ἐπειδὴ τὸ μέλλον (since the future) ἀφανὲς ἡμῖν ἐστίν, τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν δὲ τέλος καὶ τέλειον τίθεμεν πάντῃ πάντως]. This being so, we shall call blessed those of the living who have and will continue to have the things mentioned, but blessed only in human terms [εἰ δ᾽ οὕτω, μακαρίους ἐροῦμεν {20} τῶν ζώντων οἷς ὑπάρχει καὶ ὑπάρξει τὰ λεχθέντα, μακαρίους δ᾽ ἀνθρώπους].

So much for the distinctions we draw in these areas [καὶ περὶ μὲν τούτων ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον (this much) διωρίσθω (let it be determined)].

Chapter 11

Nevertheless, the idea that the fortunes of a person's descendants and all his friends have no effect on him seems excessively heartless and contrary to what people think [τὰς δὲ τῶν ἀπογόνων τύχας καὶ τῶν φίλων (friends) ἁπάντων τὸ μὲν μηδοτιοῦν συμβάλλεσθαι (nothing to contribute) λίαν (too much) ἄφιλον φαίνεται καὶ ταῖς δόξαις ἐναντίον (contrary)]. But, given that the things that happen are many and various, some affecting us more and others less, it looks as if it would be a long --even interminable-- job to distinguish them in detail. It will be enough, perhaps, to give a general outline [πολλῶν δὲ καὶ παντοίας ἐχόντων διαφορὰς {25} τῶν συμβαινόντων (things that happen), καὶ τῶν μὲν μᾶλλον συνικνουμένων τῶν δ᾽ ἧττον, καθ᾽ ἕκαστον μὲν διαιρεῖν (to distinguish) μακρὸν καὶ ἀπέραντον φαίνεται, καθόλου (generally) δὲ λεχθὲν καὶ τύπῳ (in outline) τάχ᾽ ἂν ἱκανῶς (sufficiently) ἔχοι (it might be)].

If, then, as some of a person's misfortunes have a certain weight and influence on his life, while others seem lighter, so too there are similar differences between the fortunes of all his friends [εἰ δή, καθάπερ καὶ τῶν περὶ αὑτὸν (concerning oneself) ἀτυχημάτων τὰ μὲν ἔχει τι βρῖθος καὶ ῥοπὴν (have some weight and influence) πρὸς τὸν βίον τὰ {30} δ᾽ ἐλαφροτέροις ἔοικεν, οὕτω καὶ τὰ περὶ τοὺς φίλους ὁμοίως ἅπαντας]; and if it makes a difference whether each of these misfortunes (παθῶν) happens to people when they are alive or when they are dead (a greater difference even than whether the dreadful crimes in tragedies happened before the play or are perpetrated on the stage); then this difference must be taken into account in our reasoning (συλλογιστέον), or rather, perhaps, the fact that there is a puzzle about whether the dead can partake of any good or evil [διαφέρει δὲ τῶν παθῶν ἕκαστον περὶ ζῶντας ἢ τελευτήσαντας συμβαίνειν (to happen) πολὺ μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ παράνομα καὶ δεινὰ (outrageous deeds and terrible things) προϋπάρχειν ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις ἢ πράττεσθαι (or to be performed), συλλογιστέον δὴ καὶ ταύτην τὴν διαφοράν, μᾶλλον δ᾽ ἴσως {35} τὸ διαπορεῖσθαι (to be puzzled over) περὶ τοὺς κεκμηκότας εἴ τινος ἀγαθοῦ κοινωνοῦσιν (they partake in) ἢ τῶν ἀντικειμένων (or the opposite things)]. For it does seem, from what we have said, that if anything good or bad does actually affect them, it will be pretty unimportant and insignificant, either in itself or in relation to them; or if not, it must at least be of such an extent and kind as not to make happy those who are not happy already nor to deprive those who are happy of their being blessed [{1101b} ἔοικε γὰρ ἐκ τούτων εἰ καὶ διικνεῖται (even if it reaches) πρὸς αὐτοὺς ὁτιοῦν (anything), εἴτ᾽ ἀγαθὸν εἴτε τοὐναντίον (the opposite), ἀφαυρόν τι καὶ μικρὸν ἢ ἁπλῶς ἢ ἐκείνοις εἶναι (for them to be), εἰ δὲ μή, τοσοῦτόν γε καὶ τοιοῦτον ὥστε μὴ ποιεῖν εὐδαίμονας τοὺς μὴ ὄντας {5} μηδὲ τοὺς ὄντας ἀφαιρεῖσθαι (to take away) τὸ μακάριον]. So when friends do well, and likewise when they do badly, it does seem to have some effect on the dead. But it is of such a nature and degree as neither to make not happy those who are happy, nor anything like that [συμβάλλεσθαι μὲν οὖν τι φαίνονται τοῖς κεκμηκόσιν (those who have died) αἱ εὐπραξίαι τῶν φίλων, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ αἱ δυσπραξίαι (malas acciones), τοιαῦτα δὲ καὶ τηλικαῦτα ὥστε μήτε (neither) τοὺς εὐδαίμονας μὴ εὐδαίμονας ποιεῖν μήτ᾽ (nor) ἄλλο τῶν τοιούτων μηδέν].








..
Chapter 12

Now that these matters have been sorted out, let us consider whether happiness is a thing to be praised or instead something to be honoured. For it is clearly not just a capacity (δυνάμεων) [{10}  διωρισμένων δὲ τούτων ἐπισκεψώμεθα (let us consider) περὶ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας πότερα (whether) τῶν ἐπαινετῶν ἐστὶν ἢ μᾶλλον (or rather) τῶν τιμίων: δῆλον (it's clear) γὰρ ὅτι τῶν γε δυνάμεων οὐκ ἔστιν].

Anything that is praised (ἐπαινετὸν) seems to be praised for its being of a certain kind and its standing in a certain relation to something else: the just person, the brave person (ἀνδρεῖον), and the good person and virtue in general we praise for their actions and what they bring about (διὰ τὰς πράξεις καὶ τὰ ἔργα). And we praise the strong person, the fast runner, and each of the others, because he is naturally of a certain kind and stands in some sort of relation to something good and excellent (σπουδαῖον) [φαίνεται δὴ πᾶν τὸ ἐπαινετὸν (praiseworthy thing) τῷ ποιόν τι εἶναι καὶ πρός τι πῶς ἔχειν ἐπαινεῖσθαι: τὸν γὰρ δίκαιον (just man) καὶ τὸν ἀνδρεῖον καὶ ὅλως τὸν {15} ἀγαθόν τε καὶ τὴν ἀρετὴν ἐπαινοῦμεν (we praise) διὰ τὰς πράξεις καὶ τὰ ἔργα, καὶ τὸν ἰσχυρὸν δὲ καὶ τὸν δρομικὸν (swift runner) καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἕκαστον τῷ ποιόν (being of a certain quality) τινα πεφυκέναι καὶ ἔχειν πως πρὸς ἀγαθόν τι καὶ σπουδαῖον]. This is clear also from praise of the gods. For it seems absurd that they should be judged by reference to us, but this happens because, as we have said, praise involves reference to something else [δῆλον δὲ τοῦτο καὶ ἐκ τῶν περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ἐπαίνων: γελοῖοι (ridiculous) γὰρ φαίνονται πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀναφερόμενοι (in relation to us being referred), {20} τοῦτο δὲ συμβαίνει (happens) διὰ τὸ γίνεσθαι τοὺς ἐπαίνους δι᾽ ἀναφορᾶς (reference), ὥσπερ εἴπομεν]. But if praise applies only to things standing in relations, clearly it is not praise that applies to the best things (τῶν ἀρίστων), but something greater and better. This is in fact obvious, since the gods and the most godlike of people we call blessed and happy [εἰ δ᾽ ἐστὶν ὁ ἔπαινος τῶν τοιούτων, δῆλον ὅτι τῶν ἀρίστων οὐκ ἔστιν ἔπαινος, ἀλλὰ μεῖζόν (something greater) τι καὶ βέλτιον, καθάπερ (just as) καὶ φαίνεται: τούς τε γὰρ θεοὺς μακαρίζομεν καὶ εὐδαιμονίζομεν καὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν τοὺς θειοτάτους {25} μακαρίζομεν]. The same goes for things that are good, since we never praise happiness as we might justice, but rather call it blessed, as something better and more divine [ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τῶν ἀγαθῶν: οὐδεὶς γὰρ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ἐπαινεῖ (praises) καθάπερ τὸ δίκαιον, ἀλλ᾽ ὡς θειότερόν τι καὶ βέλτιον μακαρίζει (calls blessed)].

And Eudoxus seems to have been right in pressing the claims of pleasure to supremacy. He believed that the fact that it is not praised despite its being a good indicates that it is better than things that are praised; and he thought that god and the good are like this, because it is by reference to these that other goods are praised [δοκεῖ δὲ καὶ Εὔδοξος καλῶς συνηγορῆσαι (to have argued in favor of) περὶ τῶν ἀριστείων τῇ ἡδονῇ: τὸ γὰρ μὴ ἐπαινεῖσθαι τῶν ἀγαθῶν οὖσαν μηνύειν ᾤετο ὅτι κρεῖττόν (better) ἐστι {30} τῶν ἐπαινετῶν, τοιοῦτον δ᾽ εἶναι τὸν θεὸν καὶ τἀγαθόν: ταῦτα πρὸς (in relation to these things) γὰρ καὶ τἆλλα (the other things) ἀναφέρεσθαι]. For praise is indeed appropriate to virtue, since it makes us the kind of people to perform noble actions; eulogies (ἐγκώμια), however, are bestowed on what is achieved (τῶν ἔργων) in the spheres of the body and of the soul alike [ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἔπαινος τῆς ἀρετῆς: πρακτικοὶ γὰρ τῶν καλῶν ἀπὸ ταύτης: τὰ δ᾽ ἐγκώμια τῶν ἔργων ὁμοίως καὶ τῶν σωματικῶν καὶ τῶν ψυχικῶν]. But perhaps clarity here is more the job of those who have gone into the subject of encomiums. For us, anyway, it is clear from what has been said that happiness is something honourable and complete [ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν ἴσως (perhaps) οἰκειότερον ἐξακριβοῦν {35} τοῖς περὶ τὰ ἐγκώμια πεπονημένοις (having labored): ἡμῖν δὲ δῆλον ἐκ τῶν εἰρημένων {1102a} ὅτι ἐστὶν ἡ εὐδαιμονία τῶν τιμίων καὶ τελείων].

And that it is so seems to follow as well from its being a first principle. It is for the sake of this this we all do all the rest of our actions, and the first principle and cause of goods we take to be something honourable and divine [ἔοικε δ᾽ οὕτως ἔχειν καὶ διὰ τὸ εἶναι ἀρχή: ταύτης (for the sake of this) γὰρ χάριν τὰ λοιπὰ πάντα πάντες πράττομεν, τὴν ἀρχὴν δὲ καὶ τὸ αἴτιον τῶν ἀγαθῶν τίμιόν τι καὶ θεῖον τίθεμεν (we consider)].







..
Chapter 13

Since happiness is a certain kind of activity of the soul in accordance with complete virtue, we ought to look at virtue. For perhaps then we might be in a better position to consider happiness [{5} ἐπεὶ δ᾽ ἐστὶν ἡ εὐδαιμονία ψυχῆς ἐνέργειά τις κατ᾽ ἀρετὴν τελείαν, περὶ ἀρετῆς ἐπισκεπτέον ἂν εἴη: τάχα γὰρ οὕτως ἂν βέλτιον καὶ περὶ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας θεωρήσαιμεν].

Besides, the true politician is thought to have taken special pains over this, since he wants to make citizens good and obedient to the laws [δοκεῖ δὲ καὶ ὁ κατ᾽ ἀλήθειαν πολιτικὸς περὶ ταύτην μάλιστα πεπονῆσθαι: βούλεται γὰρ τοὺς πολίτας ἀγαθοὺς ποιεῖν καὶ τῶν {10} νόμων ὑπηκόους]. As an example, we have the lawgivers (νομοθέτας) of the Cretans and the Spartans, and any others of that ilk [παράδειγμα δὲ τούτων ἔχομεν τοὺς Κρητῶν καὶ Λακεδαιμονίων νομοθέτας, καὶ εἴ τινες ἕτεροι τοιοῦτοι γεγένηνται]. If this inquiry (σκέψις) is a part of political science, pursuing it will clearly accord with our original purpose [εἰ δὲ τῆς πολιτικῆς ἐστὶν ἡ σκέψις αὕτη, δῆλον ὅτι γίνοιτ᾽ ἂν ἡ ζήτησις (pursuing) κατὰ τὴν ἐξ ἀρχῆς προαίρεσιν (original plan)].

Clearly (δῆλον), it is human virtue we must consider, since we were looking for human good and human happiness [περὶ ἀρετῆς δὲ ἐπισκεπτέον ἀνθρωπίνης δῆλον ὅτι: καὶ γὰρ τἀγαθὸν {15} ἀνθρώπινον ἐζητοῦμεν καὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ἀνθρωπίνην]. By human virtue, we mean that of the soul, not that of the body; and happiness we speak of as an activity of the soul [ἀρετὴν δὲ λέγομεν ἀνθρωπίνην οὐ τὴν τοῦ σώματος ἀλλὰ τὴν τῆς ψυχῆς: καὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν δὲ ψυχῆς ἐνέργειαν λέγομεν]. If this is right, the politician clearly must have some understanding (εἰδέναι) of the sphere of the soul, as the person who is to attend to eyes must have some understanding of the whole body; more so, indeed, in that political science is superior to medicine, and held in higher esteem, and even among doctors, the sophisticated ones go to a great deal of effort to understand (γνῶσιν) the body [εἰ δὲ ταῦθ᾽ οὕτως ἔχει, δῆλον ὅτι δεῖ τὸν πολιτικὸν εἰδέναι πως τὰ περὶ ψυχῆς, ὥσπερ καὶ τὸν ὀφθαλμοὺς θεραπεύσοντα (who will treat) {20} καὶ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα, καὶ μᾶλλον ὅσῳ τιμιωτέρα καὶ βελτίων ἡ πολιτικὴ τῆς ἰατρικῆς: τῶν δ᾽ ἰατρῶν οἱ χαρίεντες (the skilled ones) πολλὰ πραγματεύονται περὶ τὴν τοῦ σώματος γνῶσιν]. The politician, then, must consider the soul, and consider it with a view to understanding virtue, just to the extent that is required by the inquiry, because attaining a higher degree of precision is perhaps too much trouble for his current purpose [θεωρητέον δὴ καὶ τῷ πολιτικῷ περὶ ψυχῆς, θεωρητέον δὲ τούτων χάριν (with these objects in view, χάριν:sake), καὶ ἐφ᾽ ὅσον ἱκανῶς (sufficiently) ἔχει (it is relevant) πρὸς τὰ ζητούμενα: {25} τὸ γὰρ ἐπὶ πλεῖον ἐξακριβοῦν (to determine exactly) ἐργωδέστερον ἴσως ἐστὶ τῶν προκειμένων].

Some aspects of the soul have been dealt with competently in our popular works as well, and we should make use of these. It is said, for example, that one element of the soul has reason, while another lacks it [λέγεται δὲ περὶ αὐτῆς (concerning it) καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐξωτερικοῖς λόγοις ἀρκούντως (sufficiently) ἔνια, καὶ χρηστέον αὐτοῖς: οἷον τὸ μὲν ἄλογον αὐτῆς εἶναι, τὸ δὲ λόγον ἔχον]. It does not matter for the moment whether these elements are separate like the parts of the body or anything else that can be physically divided, or whether they are naturally inseparable but differentiated in thought, like the convex and concave aspects of a curved surface [ταῦτα δὲ πότερον διώρισται καθάπερ τὰ τοῦ σώματος μόρια (body parts) καὶ πᾶν τὸ {30} μεριστόν, ἢ τῷ λόγῳ δύο ἐστὶν ἀχώριστα πεφυκότα καθάπερ ἐν τῇ περιφερείᾳ (circumference) τὸ κυρτὸν καὶ τὸ κοῖλον, οὐθὲν διαφέρει πρὸς τὸ παρόν (It does not matter for the moment)].

Of the element without reason, one part seems to be common: the vegetative (φυτικῷ), the cause of nutrition and growth. For one should assume such a capacity of the soul (δύναμιν τῆς ψυχῆς) to exist in everything that takes in nutrition, even embryos, and to be the same in fully grown beings, since this is more reasonable than assuming that they have a different capacity [τοῦ ἀλόγου δὲ τὸ μὲν ἔοικε (seems) κοινῷ καὶ φυτικῷ, λέγω δὲ τὸ αἴτιον τοῦ τρέφεσθαι (to be nourished) καὶ αὔξεσθαι (to grow): τὴν τοιαύτην γὰρ δύναμιν τῆς ψυχῆς ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς τρεφομένοις θείη τις ἂν {1102b} καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἐμβρύοις, τὴν αὐτὴν δὲ ταύτην καὶ ἐν τοῖς τελείοις: εὐλογώτερον γὰρ ἢ ἄλλην τινά].

The virtue of this element is clearly something shared and not specific to human beings. For this part and its capacity are thought more than others to be active during sleep, and the good and bad person to be hardest to distinguish when they are asleep (hence the saying that the happy are no different from the wretched for half of their lives -- which makes sense, since sleep is a time when the soul is not engaged in the things that lead to its being called good or bad), except that in some way certain movements on a small scale reach the soul, and make the dreams (φαντάσματα) of good people better than those of ordinary people [ταύτης μὲν οὖν κοινή τις ἀρετὴ καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρωπίνη φαίνεται: δοκεῖ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς ὕπνοις (sleep) ἐνεργεῖν μάλιστα τὸ μόριον (this part) τοῦτο καὶ {5} ἡ δύναμις αὕτη, ὁ δ᾽ ἀγαθὸς καὶ κακὸς ἥκιστα διάδηλοι καθ᾽ ὕπνον (ὅθεν φασὶν οὐδὲν διαφέρειν τὸ ἥμισυ (half) τοῦ βίου τοὺς εὐδαίμονας τῶν ἀθλίων: συμβαίνει δὲ τοῦτο εἰκότως: ἀργία (inactivity) γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ὕπνος τῆς ψυχῆς ᾗ λέγεται σπουδαία καὶ φαύλη), πλὴν (except) εἰ μὴ κατὰ μικρὸν καὶ διικνοῦνταί τινες τῶν κινήσεων, {10} καὶ ταύτῃ βελτίω γίνεται τὰ φαντάσματα τῶν ἐπιεικῶν ἢ τῶν τυχόντων (ordinary people)]. But enough of this. Let us leave the nutritive capacity aside, since by nature it plays no role (ἄμοιρον) in human virtue [ἀλλὰ περὶ μὲν τούτων ἅλις (enough), καὶ τὸ θρεπτικὸν ἐατέον (must be left aside), ἐπειδὴ (since) τῆς ἀνθρωπικῆς ἀρετῆς ἄμοιρον πέφυκεν].

But there does seem to be another natural element in the soul, lacking reason, but nevertheless, as it were, partaking in it [ἔοικε δὲ καὶ ἄλλη τις φύσις τῆς ψυχῆς ἄλογος εἶναι, μετέχουσα (participating) μέντοι (however) πῃ λόγου]. For we praise (ἐπαινοῦμεν) the reason of the self-controlled and of the incontinent, that is, the part of their soul with reason, because it urges them in the right direction, towards what is best; but clearly there is within them another natural element besides reason, which conflicts with and resists it [τοῦ γὰρ ἐγκρατοῦς καὶ ἀκρατοῦς τὸν {15} λόγον καὶ τῆς ψυχῆς τὸ λόγον ἔχον ἐπαινοῦμεν: ὀρθῶς γὰρ καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ βέλτιστα (aright and towards what is best) παρακαλεῖ: φαίνεται δ᾽ ἐν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἄλλο τι παρὰ τὸν λόγον πεφυκός (naturally opposed to the rational principle), ὃ μάχεται καὶ ἀντιτείνει τῷ λόγῳ (fights and resists that principle... pneuma!)]. For just as paralysed limbs, when one rationally chooses to move them to the right, are carried off in the opposite direction to the left, so also in the soul: the impulses of incontinent people carry them off in the opposite direction [ἀτεχνῶς γὰρ καθάπερ τὰ παραλελυμένα τοῦ σώματος μόρια (parts) εἰς τὰ δεξιὰ προαιρουμένων (intending) κινῆσαι {20} τοὐναντίον (the opposite) εἰς τὰ ἀριστερὰ παραφέρεται (is carried along), καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς ψυχῆς οὕτως: ἐπὶ τἀναντία γὰρ αἱ ὁρμαὶ (impulsos) τῶν ἀκρατῶν]. In the body we do indeed see the lack of control, while in the soul we do not see it [ἀλλ᾽ ἐν τοῖς σώμασι μὲν ὁρῶμεν (we see) τὸ παραφερόμενον, ἐπὶ δὲ τῆς ψυχῆς οὐχ ὁρῶμεν]; but I think that we should nevertheless hold that there is some element in the soul besides reason, opposing and running counter to it (resisting and opposing it) [ἴσως δ᾽ οὐδὲν ἧττον καὶ ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ νομιστέον εἶναί (one must suppose to be) τι παρὰ τὸν λόγον (contrary to the rational principle), ἐναντιούμενον τούτῳ καὶ ἀντιβαῖνον]. In what way it is distinct from the other elements does not matter [{25} πῶς δ᾽ ἕτερον, οὐδὲν διαφέρει]. But it does seem to partake in reason, as we said. The element in the soul of the self-controlled person, at least, obeys reason and presumably in the temperate and the brave person it is still more ready to listen, since in their case it is in total harmony with reason [λόγου δὲ καὶ τοῦτο φαίνεται μετέχειν, ὥσπερ εἴπομεν: πειθαρχεῖ (it obeys) γοῦν (indeed) τῷ λόγῳ τὸ τοῦ ἐγκρατοῦς (continent) -- ἔτι δ᾽ ἴσως εὐηκοώτερόν [more obedient] ἐστι τὸ τοῦ σώφρονος καὶ ἀνδρείου: πάντα γὰρ ὁμοφωνεῖ (it accords) τῷ λόγῳ].

So the element without reason seems itself to have two parts [φαίνεται δὴ καὶ τὸ ἄλογον διττόν]. For the vegetative part has no share at all in reason, while the part consisting in appetite and desire in general does share in it in a way, in so far as it listens to and obeys it. So it has reason in the sense that a person who listens to the reason of his father and his friends is said to have reason, not reason in the mathematical sense [τὸ μὲν γὰρ φυτικὸν οὐδαμῶς κοινωνεῖ {30} λόγου, τὸ δ᾽ ἐπιθυμητικὸν καὶ ὅλως ὀρεκτικὸν μετέχει πως, ᾗ κατήκοόν (it listens to) ἐστιν αὐτοῦ καὶ πειθαρχικόν (obeys): οὕτω δὴ καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τῶν φίλων φαμὲν ἔχειν (we say [it] has) λόγον, καὶ οὐχὥσπερ τῶν μαθηματικῶν]. That the element without reason is in some way persuaded by reason is indicated as well by the offering of advice, and all kinds of criticism and encouragement [ὅτι δὲ πείθεταί (it is persuaded) πως ὑπὸ λόγου τὸ ἄλογον, μηνύει καὶ ἡ νουθέτησις (admonition) καὶ πᾶσα ἐπιτίμησίς (reproof) τε καὶ παράκλησις (calling, encouragement)]. And if we must say that this element possesses reason, then the element with reason will also have two parts, one, in the strict sense, possessing it in itself, the other ready to listen to reason as one is ready to listen to the reason of one's father [{1103a} εἰ δὲ χρὴ καὶ τοῦτο φάναι λόγον ἔχειν, διττὸν ἔσται καὶ τὸ λόγον ἔχον, τὸ μὲν (on the one hand) κυρίως καὶ ἐν αὑτῷ, τὸ δ᾽ (the other) ὥσπερ τοῦ πατρὸς ἀκουστικόν (capable of listening) τι].

Virtue is distinguished along the same lines. Some virtues we say are intellectual, such as wisdom, judgement and practical wisdom, while others are virtues of character, such as generosity and temperance [διορίζεται δὲ καὶ ἡ ἀρετὴ κατὰ τὴν διαφορὰν ταύτην: λέγομεν γὰρ αὐτῶν τὰς {5} μὲν διανοητικὰς τὰς δὲ ἠθικάς, σοφίαν μὲν καὶ σύνεσιν καὶ φρόνησιν διανοητικάς, ἐλευθεριότητα δὲ καὶ σωφροσύνην ἠθικάς]. For when we are talking about a person's character (ἤθους), we do not say that he is wise or has judgement, but that he is even-tempered or temperate. Yet we do praise the wise person for his state (ἕξιν), and the states worthy of praise we call virtues [λέγοντες γὰρ περὶ τοῦ ἤθους οὐ λέγομεν ὅτι σοφὸς ἢ συνετὸς ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι πρᾶος ἢ σώφρων: ἐπαινοῦμεν δὲ καὶ τὸν σοφὸν κατὰ τὴν ἕξιν: τῶν ἕξεων δὲ τὰς ἐπαινετὰς ἀρετὰς {10} λέγομεν].

Book II 



Chapter 1

Virtue, then, is of two kinds: that of the intellect and that of character. Intellectual virtue owes its origin and development mainly to teaching, for which reason its attainment requires experience and time; virtue of character (ἠθικὴ) is a result of habituation (ἔθους), for which reason it has acquired its name through a small variation on 'ἔθους' [{14} διττῆς (twofold) δὴ τῆς ἀρετῆς οὔσης, τῆς μὲν διανοητικῆς τῆς {15} δὲ ἠθικῆς, ἡ μὲν διανοητικὴ τὸ πλεῖον ἐκ διδασκαλίας ἔχει καὶ τὴν γένεσιν καὶ τὴν αὔξησιν, διόπερ ἐμπειρίας δεῖται (it needs) καὶ χρόνου, ἡ δ᾽ ἠθικὴ ἐξ ἔθους περιγίνεται, ὅθεν καὶ τοὔνομα ἔσχηκε μικρὸν παρεκκλῖνον ἀπὸ τοῦ ἔθους]. From this it is clear that none of the virtues of character arises in us by nature. For nothing natural can be made to behave differently by habituation [ἐξ οὗ καὶ δῆλον ὅτι οὐδεμία τῶν ἠθικῶν ἀρετῶν φύσει ἡμῖν ἐγγίνεται: οὐθὲν {20} γὰρ τῶν φύσει ὄντων ἄλλως ἐθίζεται]. For example, a stone that naturally falls downwards could not be made by habituation to rise upwards, not even if one tried to habituate it by throwing it up ten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to burn downwards, nor anything else that naturally behaves in one way be habituated to behave differently [, οἷον ὁ λίθος φύσει κάτω φερόμενος οὐκ ἂν ἐθισθείη ἄνω φέρεσθαι, οὐδ᾽ ἂν μυριάκις αὐτὸν ἐθίζῃ τις ἄνω ῥιπτῶν, οὐδὲ τὸ πῦρ κάτω, οὐδ᾽ ἄλλο οὐδὲν τῶν ἄλλως πεφυκότων ἄλλως ἂν ἐθισθείη]. So virtues arise in us neither by nature nor contrary to nature, but nature gives us the capacity to acquire them, and completion comes through habituation.

Again, in all the cases where something arises in us by nature, we ®rst acquire the capacities and later exhibit the activities. This is clear in the case of the senses, since we did not acquire them by seeing often or hearing often; we had them before we used them, and did not acquire them by using them. Virtues, however, we acquire by ®rst exercising them. The same is true with skills, since what we need to learn before doing, we learn by doing; for example, we become builders by building, and lyre-players by playing the lyre. So too we become just by doing just actions, temperate by temperate actions, and courageous by coura- geous actions. What happens in cities bears this out as well, because

aretai -> estados (exeon, exis: state of mind para ross)
eudaimonia -> actividad (energeia)

. el gran punto para la filosofía práctica es decidir vivir according to phusis. Comprender qué significa esto y jugarse la vida en esa decisión... come what may.


. max-vi coincidencia entre phusis y pneuma sobre el logos dirigido al ser humano en especial: ARETE! hay que sintonizar con la phusis y amarla - amar su palabra, para hacer realidad en el mayor grado posible.
la vida es superarse...
.. toda cuestión práctico-política es referida a la felicidad de los ciudadanos (actuales y porvenir), lo que lleva a la phusis, vivir de acuerdo con la phusis que es vivir de acuerdo con la max-racionalidad... y esto es max-justo enseñarlo a los niños para iniciarlos en el camino de las tareas infinitas... amor a la arete!
.. phusis y felicidad como ejes de rtas del modelo de ia.
.. eudaimonia como florecimiento (phusis!!)... mediante la adquisición de virtudes we shall live a life of happiness (εὐδαιμονήσειν) (=>aretai son bienes para el bien mayor de vivir una vida feliz, ie, de ser feliz, ie, realizar el bien de la felicidad).
.. las personas y bienes dan felicidad pero no hacen feliz a un hombre... nunca ES feliz... avanza en el florecimiento mientras vive y fue feliz (logró florecer) al morir. Puede haber retrospectivamente florecimientos completados.

. felicidad tiene que ver la concreción... de bienes menores sí, pero los grandes no van a experimentarse realizados... ahí entra alto nous y conexión con phusis, para gozo de encaminarse ok y haber colaborado.
.. experiencia de felicidad w+fuerte cuando se está en camino a summum bonum.

. una manera de evaluar la calidad de la felicidad, es su duración y frecuencia de reaparición... las opciones ko, duran w-poco, pierden fuerza y vigencia (se repiten y no generan efectos felices, transformar la vida como un todo esp, la teoría de los vectores de jmarias es v-interesante, un vector conecta con la felicidad [como relámpago con pararrayo] y los demás se alteran para max-ok, vibran en una frecuencia especial).
.. felicidad aparece gracias (aitia, much indebted) a un vector, pero resuena en todos (vs placer, conformidad, etc.).
.. vi para terapia, identificar vectores de posible acontecimiento de la felicidad, y organizarlos en instalaciones, para promover esas instalaciones y evitar las configuraciones vectoriales que causan stress, ansiedad, frustración y cualquier tipo de tristeza.
.. gozar de un momento de felicidad (felicidad=>gozo, leatitia)... la clave está en que ese 'momento' se puede distender y eternizar.
.. teoría de jmarias para la vida humana, tiene dos pilares: instalación y vectorización.
.. El ser vectorial hace que la felicidad acontezca; es una instalación, no simplemente un estado; acontece, crece o mengua, en grados de intensidad variable, pero también en diversas direcciones. 
.. Esas personas, tantas en nuestro tiempo, identifican la felicidad con otras cosas; buscan lo que da riqueza, poder, placer, pero no felicidad. 


. que rodri pregunte a sabios por el fundamento de nuestra posición política... por qué es buena la justicia social, y si hay otros bienes superiores o es el fin ultimo... ie pregunta por origen y fin ultimo (summum bonum).
.. correr el foco del filósofo y su escritura -- enseñanza hacia la phusis, se aprende del logos -- palabra de la phusis, pero hay que aprender a conectar con ella, a interpretar su logos... y amarla. Sin eso cualquier plantamiento teórico está destinado a la ruina (si es que llega a construir algo).
.. mas que ubicar gente ok en estructuras de estos estados fallidos, hay que conformar los hombres ok para las estructuras 'nuevas' (flia esp, soc civil con contratos w-simples y poder de policía como administración de justicia, y deliberaciones para asambleas proyectadas hacia sistema de justicia y tribunales propio de estado etico.
